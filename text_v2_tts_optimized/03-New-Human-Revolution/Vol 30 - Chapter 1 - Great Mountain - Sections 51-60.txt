# Volume 30: Chapter 1, Great Mountain 51–60

## Great Mountain 51

At a leaders meeting, Shin'ichi Yamamoto steps down after 19 years as Soka Gakkai president, passing leadership to Kiyoshi Jujo. Shin'ichi uses humor to ease tension, then explains the Seven Bells represented second president Josei Toda's determination for kosen-rufu's global development. He emphasizes organizational renewal ensures longevity, praising Jujo's judgment and experience.

Shin'ichi notes General Director Kazumasa Morikawa's unwavering faith despite limited visibility. He urges members to embrace unity through "many in body, one in mind," citing Nichiren Daishonin's teaching that this spirit enables achieving all goals.

## Great Mountain 52

Shin'ichi speaks passionately about maintaining steady progress toward kosen-rufu despite inevitable changes. He stresses individual members should awaken to their personal missions for propagating the Law.

He characterizes the organization as a framework—like a skeleton—that becomes meaningful only through earnest kosen-rufu activities. Leaders must avoid bureaucratic detachment, instead ensuring the organization nourishes members through mutual care.

Shin'ichi emphasizes the Gohonzon's absolute benefit and encourages members to advance without emotional wavering, ultimately seeking their happiness and that of their families.

## Great Mountain 53

New president Jujo acknowledges Yamamoto's years of urging leaders toward independence. He confesses initial reluctance about Yamamoto's resignation but recognizes the necessity for sustainable kosen-rufu development.

Jujo acknowledges his limited abilities yet commits to working diligently with member support. He reflects on the selfless efforts of Makiguchi, Toda, and Yamamoto, vowing to carry their spirit into the 21st century with renewed determination daily.

## Great Mountain 54

Jujo requests members call him by name rather than "Sensei," reserving that honorific for the three founding presidents. He proposes advancing as equals through mutual encouragement.

He commits to serving members and creating environments for joyful Buddhist practice. The passage notes genuine guidance involves leaders modeling determination and inspiring others through authentic connection rather than hierarchical instruction.

## Great Mountain 55

At the Shizuoka Training Center, Shin'ichi contemplates advancing worldwide kosen-rufu through dialogue with global leaders and thinkers. He meets with various divisions, reaffirming the mentor-disciple path and encouraging fresh efforts.

However, Shin'ichi faces restrictions. Attorney Tomomasa Yamawaki and certain Nichiren Shoshu priests plot to isolate him from members and control the organization. They prohibit his attendance at meetings and limit publication coverage to overseas activities.

Their strategy aims severing the mentor-disciple bond that constitutes the Soka Gakkai's lifeblood.

## Great Mountain 56

The passage explores the Lotus Sutra's "Bodhisattva Never Disparaging" chapter, describing successive Awesome Sound King Buddhas. Toda suggested viewing these Buddhas collectively as an organization—a harmonious practitioners' community.

"Soka Gakkai Buddha" represents a network of members dedicated to kosen-rufu, connecting through mentor-disciple bonds following Makiguchi and Toda's examples.

Three requirements sustain this eternal organization: lifelong commitment to kosen-rufu's great vow; steadfastly walking the mentor-disciple path; and uniting in "many in body, one in mind" spirit.

## Great Mountain 57

Shin'ichi vows creating capable successors to continue kosen-rufu. He recalls January 6, 1951, when Toda, facing business collapse, entrusted everything to him, including the Gakkai, credit union, and commerce ventures.

Amid adversity, Toda emphasized that Shin'ichi's mission was his own mission. He urged unwavering strength regardless of circumstances, exemplifying the mentor-disciple way of striving together undeterred by challenges.

## Great Mountain 58

Toda focuses on kosen-rufu's future by entrusting succession to Shin'ichi. He reaffirms that if they remain true to their mission, Nichiren's wishes will be fulfilled.

Shin'ichi responds with tear-filled eyes, pledging lifelong devotion without regret. This dialogue occurs during Toda's desperate struggle.

Shin'ichi recalls the samurai Kusunoki Masashige's farewell to his son Masatsura before the 1336 Battle of Minatogawa. Toda loved the accompanying song "Dainanko," frequently requesting young men's division members perform it, as it expressed his hope for Soka Gakkai youth assuming responsibility for kosen-rufu.

## Great Mountain 59

At the Shizuoka Training Center, Shin'ichi deeply comprehends Masashige's and Toda's feelings when entrusting successors before departing for perilous journeys. He understands how profound Toda's January 1951 resolve must have been.

Shin'ichi plays "Dainanko" on the training center's piano with vigor, internalizing its narrative of father and son's separation before battle. He vows to himself: unlike Masashige and Masatsura, ultimately defeated, he will not be defeated and will protect all members while opening new worldwide kosen-rufu spheres.

## Great Mountain 60

Shin'ichi reflects that Toda's complete entrustment and comprehensive training—especially through adversity—forged him into a true spiritual leader. Over 19 years as president, he fostered capable successors.

He desires present top leaders to assume full responsibility while he remains available for guidance as a fellow member. This arrangement allows him to develop the youth into outstanding 21st-century successors possessing courage and wisdom.

To communicate this vision, Shin'ichi records himself playing "Dainanko" on piano for youth division representatives. He dedicates the recording to young disciples, calling them toward bold advancement and encouraging each to become a true successor.
