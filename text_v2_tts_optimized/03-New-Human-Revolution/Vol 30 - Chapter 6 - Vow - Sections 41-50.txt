# Volume 30: Chapter 6, Vow 41–50

## Vow 41
Shin'ichi Yamamoto pursued peace between China and the Soviet Union during the 1970s. Though Cold War tensions temporarily increased in the 1980s following Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and the subsequent Olympic boycotts, Yamamoto continued advocating for dialogue between superpowers. When Mikhail Gorbachev implemented glasnost and perestroika beginning in 1985, Yamamoto recognized these reforms as pivotal. "When both sides are serious about peace, it is possible for them to surmount their differences and reach accord, just as rivers flowing on different courses eventually merge into the ocean."

## Vow 42
Gorbachev's reforms catalyzed historic change across Eastern Europe. The 1989 revolutions brought down communist governments in Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. On November 9, 1989, the Berlin Wall fell—fulfilling a prediction Yamamoto had made in 1961. The Malta Summit in December between Bush and Gorbachev officially marked the Cold War's end. Yamamoto remembered his conviction that conscience and wisdom would ultimately triumph over division.

## Vow 43
Gorbachev became the Soviet Union's first president in 1990 and received the Nobel Peace Prize. However, his reforms created unforeseen challenges. He explained to Yamamoto: "The first thing that perestroika has brought is freedom. But the challenge before us now is how we use that freedom." Ethnic conflicts and economic difficulties emerged as societies grappled with newly granted liberties.

## Vow 44
Boris Yeltsin defeated a hard-line communist coup in August 1991. Gorbachev's power subsequently diminished as Yeltsin's influence grew. By December 1991, the Soviet Union officially dissolved, replaced by the Commonwealth of Independent States. Though criticized, Gorbachev's leadership had brought democratic freedoms to Eastern Europe and fundamentally redirected global history.

## Vow 45
Writer Chinghiz Aitmatov shared a parable with Gorbachev illustrating the consequences of choosing freedom over authoritarian control. A prophet presented a lord with two paths: consolidating power or granting freedom to the people. The second path meant enduring ingratitude, public mockery, and betrayal from former allies. Gorbachev responded: "I will hold to my course no matter what. Democracy, freedom, and deliverance from the horrors of the past...are the only way for me."

## Vow 46
Post-Cold War challenges persisted despite Soviet collapse. Ethnic conflicts erupted in Yugoslavia, Azerbaijan, and Chechnya. Terrorism increased. Yamamoto emphasized that "the road to peace is a perilous one—which is why we must never halt our progress toward achieving it." He promoted international dialogue and UN-led systems for establishing global peace and security.

## Vow 47
The Soka Gakkai faced attacks from Shoshin-kai priests but maintained steady momentum. Yamamoto experienced personal tragedy when his son Hisahiro died unexpectedly on October 3, 1984, at age 29. Though devastated, Yamamoto maintained faith that his son's brief life held profound meaning aligned with his spiritual mission for kosen-rufu.

## Vow 48
In October 1985, Yamamoto underwent medical examination following health concerns. Recognizing he approached 58—the age his mentor Josei Toda died—he renewed his determination: he possessed a global mission requiring robust health and longevity. He reflected that suffering itself strengthens spiritual practice: "the harder we continue to strive without letting difficulties defeat us, the more our spirits are forged, strengthened, and deepened."

## Vow 49
Criminal proceedings against former Soka Gakkai legal counsel Tomomasa Yamawaki concluded when the Tokyo District Court sentenced him to three years imprisonment in March 1985 for extortion. The court found he had fabricated evidence and "colluded with activist priests" against the organization. His appeals failed, with the Supreme Court finalizing the sentence in January 1991 after a decade-long process.

## Vow 50
Yamamoto worked to strengthen priesthood-laity relations and promote Nichiren Shoshu's development. The Soka Gakkai announced plans to build 200 new temples within a decade, completing 111 by December 1990. Yamamoto emphasized that dedicated lay practitioners embody the Bodhisattva ideal, deserving respect equivalent to Buddha veneration according to Lotus Sutra teachings.
