# Volume 30: Chapter 1, Great Mountain 41–50

## Great Mountain 41

Kiyoshi Jujo explains Shin'ichi Yamamoto's decision to resign as Soka Gakkai president to prefecture leaders. Yamamoto will also step down as chief representative of Nichiren Shoshu lay organizations to take responsibility for recent tensions between the Soka Gakkai and the priesthood.

When Yamamoto enters the meeting, members react emotionally. He addresses them directly: "The struggle for kosen-rufu is always turbulent." He assures them he will continue striving in his own capacity and emphasizes that he remains a disciple of Josei Toda.

Yamamoto tells the assembled leaders: "It's important from now on for you to unite around the new president and work together to build a new Soka Gakkai." When members express sadness and ask about his future plans, he explains he will continue as a dedicated Bodhisattva of the Earth, regardless of his formal position.

He addresses youth division members specifically, stating they must not become dependent on him and should embrace this as a new era. Regarding future prefecture visits, he indicates he wants to devote more time to international peace work.

A Tohoku region prefecture leader in his 30s expresses anger, refusing to accept the resignation as final. Yamamoto responds firmly, explaining that his resignation serves the greater good. He references his predecessors—Tsunesaburo Makiguchi and Josei Toda—and calls on leaders to "stand up as courageous successors."

The Executive Council later accepts his resignation, appoints Kiyoshi Jujo as new president, designates Kazumasa Morikawa as general director, and names Yamamoto honorary president.

The newly adopted Soka Gakkai Rules and Regulations provide comprehensive governance structure for the organization. These regulations consolidate previously fragmented guidelines into one coherent framework, organizing 15 chapters covering presidential and general director selection, five-year terms, and operational procedures.

News of the resignation spreads rapidly through media coverage. Members throughout Japan react with shock—some reject the reports entirely, while others struggle to understand the decision. Soka Gakkai headquarters receives numerous calls from distressed members.

Yamamoto remains at the Shinjuku Culture Center, offering encouragement to division leaders particularly affected by his departure. That evening, a press conference at the Seikyo Shimbun building draws dozens of journalists interested in the leadership transition and its implications for Soka Gakkai-Komei Party relations.

New President Jujo expresses his aspirations, noting that "the Soka Gakkai's basic direction will remain unchanged" while announcing plans to foster capable individuals and develop the organization as a peace-building force.

When Yamamoto arrives at the press conference, he addresses reporters with candor. He describes feeling "a great sense of relief, as if I have put down a heavy load," while acknowledging new responsibilities in supporting the Soka Gakkai's continued development under Jujo's leadership.

Regarding his motivations, Yamamoto explains that serving as president for nearly two decades seemed excessive, and he believes new leadership can foster "dynamic, new creative accomplishments." He notes his age at 51 allows continued mentorship.

Yamamoto outlines his future direction, stating he wishes to "devote my time" to peace, education, and culture activities based on Buddhist principles. When reporters ask about political implications, he defers to Jujo while affirming that Soka Gakkai support for the Komei Party will continue.

Following the press conference, Yamamoto meets with youth division leaders, emphasizing that their real test comes when the mentor steps back. He urges them to "stand up resolutely" and encourages each to "become a 'Shin'ichi.'"

Late that evening, Yamamoto leaves the Seikyo Shimbun building. Reflecting privately, he recognizes that while his resignation may calm immediate tensions, deeper challenges remain regarding priesthood oppression and potential future conflicts.

His wife Mineko greets him warmly at home, expressing gratitude for his health and optimism about future opportunities. She reminds him that "now you can begin your true work," reflecting their shared understanding of his broader mission for worldwide kosen-rufu.

Late into the evening, Yamamoto records his thoughts in his diary. Despite the somber mood of the day's events, he resolves with determination: "I am not afraid of adversity! I am a lion." He feels "a passionate fighting spirit" and commits to fostering new leaders and building an indestructible organization.

Throughout the country, emergency meetings announce the leadership changes. In Kansai, leaders recite a poem Yamamoto had dedicated to Toda, declaring: "even though President Yamamoto has stepped down, he will remain our mentor here in Kansai forever!"

The following morning's Seikyo Shimbun announces the transition with the headline "The Completion of the Seven Bells and a New Leadership Lineup." Yamamoto's message to members outlines his three main reasons for stepping down and urges support for the new leadership.

At the April headquarters leaders meeting, members initially feel apprehensive upon noticing Yamamoto's customary speaking position is empty. When he enters, he energizes the room, declaring: "The Gakkai always advances dauntlessly! Remember, lions are always lions!" His confident demeanor restores members' fighting spirit and courage.
