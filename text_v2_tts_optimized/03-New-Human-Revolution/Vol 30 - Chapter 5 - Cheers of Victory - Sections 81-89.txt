# Volume 30: Chapter 5, Cheers of Victory 81–89

## Overview

This chapter documents Shin'ichi's guidance tours through Akita and Ibaraki prefectures in January and February 1982, focusing on encouraging members facing priesthood opposition and fostering young leaders for future kosen-rufu activities.

## Key Sections

**Akita Prefecture Visit (January 12-15)**

Shin'ichi visited Akita to honor pioneer members like Joryo Komatsuda, an 84-year-old who had dedicated decades to introducing people to Nichiren Buddhism. The narrative emphasizes that "the phenomenal development of the Soka Gakkai has been achieved thanks to countless such unsung heroes."

Participants were organized into groups—the "Snowstorm Group" and "Whirlwind Group"—recognizing their efforts despite severe weather conditions.

**Youth Division Emphasis**

Shin'ichi stressed to young leaders the importance of using time wisely and pursuing activities aligned with their values. He encouraged creative problem-solving, suggesting an international agricultural forum and proposing innovative uses of Akita's natural resources like snow.

The youth were designated the "1st Class of 2001," establishing a goal to advance together toward May 3, 2001. Shin'ichi stated: "I fully entrust the future of kosen-rufu to you, the youth."

**Ibaraki Prefecture Visit (February 7-12)**

This region faced severe challenges from priesthood attacks and member defections. Shin'ichi addressed the root causes of lost faith, identifying "arrogance" as a primary factor leading leaders astray. He emphasized that positions don't confer superiority, and that "steady faith" and sincere daily practice determine true victory.

The chapter concludes with the affirmation that "members had won" and had "overcome another towering trial."
