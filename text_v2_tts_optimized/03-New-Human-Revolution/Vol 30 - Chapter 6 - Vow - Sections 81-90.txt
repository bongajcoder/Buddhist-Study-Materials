# Volume 30: Chapter 6, Vow 81–90

## Vow 81

Shin'ichi Yamamoto returned to Japan after visiting India, Thailand, and Hong Kong. The 1st SGI Asia General Meeting convened in Okinawa from February 25-27, with representatives from across Asia attending.

At a gongyo session, Shin'ichi announced plans to establish a Soka Bodhi Tree Garden in New Delhi. He emphasized that Buddhist practice should bring joy rather than burden, stating: "Our Buddhist practice is not an obligation; it is our greatest privilege."

## Vow 82

The final day of the Asia General Meeting included a peace music festival featuring performances by SGI members from Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Singapore in traditional dress. Young performers—mostly born in 1972 when Okinawa returned to Japan—sang and danced with vibrant energy.

Members adopted the "Asia Declaration," committing to three points: respecting national cultures while demonstrating faith in daily life; engaging in international cultural and educational exchange; and supporting UN-centered peace efforts.

## Vow 83

Speaking to Okinawa leaders, Shin'ichi stressed the importance of nurturing young members through shared activities and by giving them leadership opportunities. He noted: "Truly great leaders are those who steadily foster youth to be even more capable than they themselves are."

He announced plans to build a training center in the Philippines and establish Soka kindergartens in Singapore and Hong Kong, describing the SGI Asia meeting as marking "the start of an age of great exchange" in philosophy, culture, and peace heading into the 21st century.

## Vow 84

Okinawa embodies two key principles: *"Nuchi du takara"* (Life is a treasure) and *"Ichariba chode"* (Once we meet, we are brothers and sisters). Despite suffering tremendous losses during World War II, Okinawans maintained their spirit of respect for life.

Shin'ichi felt called to transform Okinawa's destiny through Buddhist humanistic ideals. He began writing *The Human Revolution* in Okinawa in 1964, opening with: "Nothing is more barbarous than war. Nothing is more cruel."

## Vow 85

The Soka Gakkai opened the Okinawa Training Center in 1977 on a former U.S. missile launch site. Rather than removing it, Shin'ichi suggested keeping it as "a historical reminder of humanity's foolish obsession with war."

The missile complex was transformed into the World Peace Monument, topped with six youth statues facing the future. The grounds now feature over a hundred plant varieties, symbolizing the conversion of a weapons site into a center for peace and kosen-rufu.

## Vow 86

Addressing members at the training center via satellite broadcast, Shin'ichi declared: "Our Soka family will always advance in solidarity based on sincerity, equality, and trust, transcending national boundaries."

He emphasized that the Soka Gakkai must win its struggles, as "winning is the only way to protect our members and defend what is right." Members in Oita Prefecture had remained resolute despite recent priesthood conflicts.

## Vow 87

With the Soka Gakkai now independent from Nichiren Shoshu, Shin'ichi intensified global efforts to build foundations for worldwide kosen-rufu by the year 2000. From June-July 1992, he visited Germany, Egypt, Turkey, and other nations.

In Frankfurt, he addressed SGI members from 13 Central and Eastern European countries plus Russia. He recalled how Josei Toda had grieved for Hungarian suffering during the 1956 revolution and encouraged the emerging Bodhisattvas of the Earth in that region.

## Vow 88

In October 1992, Shin'ichi made his eighth visit to China, where the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences presented him with the title of Honorary Research Professor—a first for the institution.

In early 1993, he traveled to the United States and South America. At Claremont McKenna College, he discussed new principles of integration and the bodhisattva and Buddhahood states in Nichiren Buddhism. Nobel laureate Linus Pauling affirmed that "the bodhisattva spirit presented by Shin'ichi...was vital for the happiness of humanity."

## Vow 89

Shin'ichi met with civil rights icon Rosa Parks at Soka University's Los Angeles campus. Parks later included a photograph of their meeting in the book *Talking Pictures*, writing that it represented "the most impactful event of my life" and an opportunity to work for world peace together.

Visiting the Museum of Tolerance, Shin'ichi confronted exhibits on the Holocaust and other atrocities. He expressed profound outrage and determination: "such a tragedy must never be allowed to occur again, at any time or in any place."

## Vow 90

On February 6, 1993, Shin'ichi traveled to Colombia at President César Gaviria Trujillo's invitation, despite recent drug cartel bombings and declared emergency. When asked if he would still visit, Shin'ichi replied without hesitation that he would keep his commitment, behaving "as a citizen of Colombia, whose people are so incredibly courageous."

On February 7, an SGI chapter was established in Colombia. The following day, Shin'ichi met with President Gaviria and presented him with a composed poem praising the young leader's courage and expressing hopes for Colombia's bright future.
