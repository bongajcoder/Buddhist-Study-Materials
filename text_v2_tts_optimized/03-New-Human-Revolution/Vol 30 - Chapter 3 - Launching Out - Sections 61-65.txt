# Volume 30: Chapter 3, Launching Out 61–65

## Launching Out 61

A Japan-Soviet Student Friendship Festival occurred at Moscow State University on May 13. The Soka University Ginrei Chorus and delegation members performed Japanese and Russian songs, with both university choruses joining together for musical performances at the event's conclusion.

Shin'ichi recalled delivering a lecture at this venue six years prior titled "A New Road of East-West Cultural Exchange," where he envisioned cultural exchange as a spiritual pathway connecting world populations.

On May 14, Shin'ichi met with Soviet Premier Nikolai Tikhonov at the Kremlin, presenting flowers for the premier's 76th birthday. Describing himself as "an ordinary citizen who loves peace," Shin'ichi emphasized that genuine dialogue rooted in sincere humanity—not rhetoric—awakens people's fundamental desire for peace.

During their conversation, Shin'ichi encouraged the premier to pursue a multinational summit involving Soviet, American, Chinese, and Japanese leaders in a neutral location like Switzerland to prevent war and provide global reassurance. He stressed the importance of cultural exchange preceding diplomatic treaties between Japan and the Soviet Union.

Premier Tikhonov acknowledged that cultural exchange had lagged and agreed to pursue greater bilateral exchange. Shin'ichi also delivered a letter addressed to General Secretary Brezhnev expressing gratitude for the invitation.

Shin'ichi's 1983 and 1985 peace proposals urged U.S.-Soviet leadership dialogue. When Mikhail Gorbachev became general secretary in 1985, he initiated Cold War reconciliation, meeting with President Ronald Reagan in Geneva that November. By December 1989, Gorbachev and President George H.W. Bush declared the Cold War's end in Malta.

In 1990, Shin'ichi met with Gorbachev and they published the dialogue *Moral Lessons of the Twentieth Century*.

On May 14 evening, Shin'ichi hosted a banquet thanking those who assisted his visit. The following day, he visited Tolstoy House and the State Literary Museum of Leo Tolstoy in Moscow.

The modest 19th-century wooden residence preserved Tolstoy's study with his original desk, chair, and writing implements. He composed *Resurrection* and other significant works there during his final 19 years. The museum displayed his elementary compositions, lifelong diary, manuscripts of major novels, and a large green glass paperweight gifted by factory workers bearing inscriptions honoring his dedication to justice.

Tolstoy fought poverty and hypocrisy through his writing, resulting in harsh censorship and his excommunication by the Russian Church. The people, recognizing his sincerity and commitment to human welfare, defended him steadfastly.

Tolstoy pursued understanding genuine religion, perceiving God as humanity's highest spiritual pinnacle—the crystallization of conscience—rather than as traditionally taught. He advocated moral regeneration, rejecting violence and promoting nonviolent resistance, positions incompatible with the Russian Orthodox Church's state alignment.

His novels *Resurrection* and writings like "What I Believe" circulated underground or internationally due to publication prohibitions. Victor Hugo's observation that "Derision is counted by posterity as the sound of honor" resonated with Tolstoy's experience as worldwide support grew, including from Mahatma Gandhi.

The Church's excommunication backfired, generating international support making government suppression difficult. Instead, authorities persecuted Tolstoy's disciples, exiling Vladimir Chertkov and sentencing Paul Biriukov to internal exile, though he later completed *Leo Tolstoy: His Life and Work*.

Ordinary citizens faced persecution merely for possessing banned books, yet remained steadfast. True religion's value derives from what it brings people—courage, hope, wisdom, and liberation from suffering.

Visiting these locations, Shin'ichi found renewed courage from Tolstoy's legacy, reflecting on the proverb: "Do what you must, come what may." He felt strengthened in his mission pursuing world peace through worldwide kosen-rufu.

The group visited the Space Pavilion of the Exhibition of Achievements of National Economy, appreciating Soviet technological accomplishment. Shin'ichi expressed hope these achievements would serve humanity's peace and prosperity.

May 16 concluded Shin'ichi's eight-day Soviet visit. Before departing for Frankfurt and his European tour, Minister Vyacheslav Yelyutin invited him sailing along the Moscow-Volga canal, discussing educational exchange.

Observing the beautiful banks and waterway network connecting five seas, Shin'ichi reflected that educational exchange resembles canal building—intentionally linking diverse nations, ideologies, and peoples, creating friendship ports leading toward peace's great ocean.

At 7:00 p.m., Shin'ichi departed Sheremetyevo International Airport under bright evening daylight, excited for his European members' anticipated greeting.
