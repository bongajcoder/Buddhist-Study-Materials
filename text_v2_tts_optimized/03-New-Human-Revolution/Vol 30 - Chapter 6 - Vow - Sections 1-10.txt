# Volume 30: Chapter 6, Vow 1–10

## Vow 1
Youth development forms the foundation of organizational growth. The Soka Gakkai emphasizes nurturing young people with conviction in their Buddhist faith and awareness of their mission as practitioners. Culture festivals serve as celebrations expressing "the joy and vitality gained through their practice of Nichiren Buddhism." The first Kansai Youth Peace Culture Festival occurred on March 22, 1982, at Nagai Stadium in Osaka, following the historically significant 1966 "Kansai Culture Festival in the Rain" at Koshien Stadium.

## Vow 2
The 1982 festival was originally scheduled for two days but rain cancelled the March 21 session. Leadership encouraged participants by noting that postponement prevented excessive strain on members attempting a challenging six-tier human pyramid formation. Safety protocols included careful site preparation, physical conditioning programs, and earnest collective chanting to ensure success without accidents.

On March 22, the festival opened with 10,000 newly joined youth members marching in a "procession of peace." Performances included a 2,000-member chorus, ballet, fife and drum corps displays, rhythmic calisthenics, traditional Japanese dance, historical presentations, and gymnastics. The climax featured 4,000 young men forming multiple pyramids, culminating in an ambitious six-tier formation.

## Vow 4
The pyramid construction required precise coordination across all tiers. As each level stood upright, supporting increasing weight, a helicopter overhead created unexpected wind challenges. The final member struggled briefly to reach the sixth tier but ultimately succeeded, prompting stadium-wide applause and celebration.

## Vow 5
Koji Ueno, a team member, had suffered a serious stroke on March 6 and passed away on March 17, five days before the festival. His final words—"We'll make the impossible possible!"—became the team's inspiration. Ueno's friend Hiroyuki Kikuta honored him by participating fully. The gymnasium team achieved their first successful six-tier pyramid on March 18, the day after learning of Ueno's passing.

## Vow 6
Ueno's wife reflected on her husband's "irrefutable testimony of faith" and his dedication to Buddhist practice until death. Team members included Ueno's name in the festival resolutions, with his wife writing on his behalf: "Kosen-rufu is my life!" Participants drew strength from overcoming personal weaknesses through chanting and mutual encouragement, embodying the "Kansai spirit of breaking through impossible barriers."

## Vow 7
The Kansai spirit originated from Josei Toda's determination to eliminate poverty and suffering in Osaka. Shin'ichi Yamamoto inherited this mission, leading the region to remarkable growth—11,111 new households joined in May 1956. In July 1957, Yamamoto's arrest on election law charges sparked massive protests, forging members' commitment to justice and people's happiness.

## Vow 8
Toda's peace-focused philosophy shaped the Kansai movement. Yamamoto carried this spirit forward, actualizing happiness for countless people despite government opposition. The youth peace festival declaration pledged to spread Nichiren Buddhism globally and advance disarmament efforts, building on Toda's 1957 nuclear weapons abolition declaration.

## Vow 9
The Soka Gakkai's peace movement rests on establishing "defenses of peace" through Buddhist principles respecting human dignity. Nichiren Buddhism teaches that all people possess Buddha nature equally worthy of respect. Members practice daily human revolution, transforming negative karma while contributing to societal betterment.

## Vow 10
Mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki praised the Soka Gakkai's long-standing peace commitment and Yamamoto's dialogues with world leaders. UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar commended the organization's role as an NGO in promoting disarmament. The Soka Gakkai Peace Committee, established January 26, 1982, expanded peace activities toward the 21st century.
