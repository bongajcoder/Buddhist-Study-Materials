# Volume 30: Chapter 5, Cheers of Victory 51–60

## Cheers of Victory 51

On December 13, Shin'ichi met with approximately 50 divisional representatives and visited the Minamikyushu Women's Center. At an evening prefecture leaders meeting commemorating the Kumamoto Culture Center's fifth anniversary, he praised members from various regions for their dedication to kosen-rufu.

Shin'ichi emphasized that unity of purpose is essential for advancing kosen-rufu. He stressed that "discussion and planning are crucial" and encouraged leaders to return to fundamental questions about their activities' purpose when reaching consensus proves difficult.

Using an airline safety analogy, he explained that members must be guided safely toward lasting happiness. He referenced a teaching from President Toda: those unable to work in harmony within faith will "fall by the wayside."

Shin'ichi addressed leaders who had previously disrupted the organization by falsely claiming to be his confidants. He clarified that he treats all members equally regarding faith and that such claims indicate ulterior motives.

He shared the Daishonin's writing: "Even a feeble person will not stumble if those supporting him are strong" and emphasized that supportive fellow members are indispensable for continuing Buddhist practice.

Later, he visited the Seikyo Shimbun editorial office to review the next day's publication featuring a large photograph of Taketa members at Oka Castle.

The December 14 edition featured the photograph across two full pages with headlines celebrating the Taketa members' bravery. Many members later framed or treasured the image as a family keepsake.

On December 14, Shin'ichi also visited Fukuoka Prefecture, attending gongyo at the Kurume and Yame Community Centers and visiting Chikugo City. He reaffirmed that difficulties inevitably arise on the path to kosen-rufu and that leaders' presence and behavior during such times prove crucial.

Employing Winston Churchill as an example, Shin'ichi discussed leadership qualities. During the London Blitz, Churchill's determined presence inspired Londoners and gave them courage to resist Nazi tyranny.

He drew parallels to the Soka Gakkai's situation, declaring that those attacking the organization are "base, irrational destroyers" requiring "rock-solid conviction" to overcome. He outlined essential leadership qualities: conviction, sincerity, health, workplace excellence, and impartial judgment.

On December 15, Shin'ichi met with Nagasaki and Saga prefecture leaders and participated in an open gongyo meeting. Attendees from Kumamoto, Amakusa, Jonan region cities, and four nearby prefectures gathered.

Members from Jonan and Amakusa regions had previously been manipulated by priests into quitting the organization. Despite indignation, members maintained harmony while continuing Buddhist practice and sharing the teaching. They had now begun experiencing hope after their prolonged struggle.

The meeting adopted Amakusa and Jonan declarations expressing members' vows for kosen-rufu. Prefecture leaders announced upcoming culture centers and festivals. Shin'ichi then referenced the 1877 Satsuma Rebellion and the Nakatsu Corps' brave but tragic battle, stating his resolve to avoid sacrificing individuals in kosen-rufu efforts.

Shin'ichi taught that obstacles arise when dedicating oneself to kosen-rufu because such practice provokes the "persecution" mentioned in the Lotus Sutra. He explained that "obstacles lead to enlightenment," and that adversity can become spiritual assets.

He encouraged members not to pity themselves during difficulties but maintain "a bright, positive spirit" and conviction. Referencing the folk song "Tabaruzaka Hill," he urged members to surmount life's steep passages with determination, comparing youth division members to gallant successors holding both compassion and philosophy.

Following his speech, members from Jonan and Amakusa responded with enthusiastic applause and tears. The gathering proceeded to Itchobata Park for a group photograph of 1,500 members.

Shin'ichi proposed they sing "Tabaruzaka Hill" together—a beloved Kumamoto folk song expressing pride in their homeland. Members sang powerfully, reflecting on his guidance and pledging to overcome future adversities.

As members sang, memories of their struggles with anti-Soka Gakkai priests surfaced alongside their joy at victory. The photograph was later printed prominently in the December 17 Seikyo Shimbun.

Shin'ichi composed poems for Jonan and Amakusa representatives, acknowledging their endurance through storms and their smiling dedication to kosen-rufu. On December 16, he returned to Tokyo after completing his nine-day Kyushu guidance tour.

Shin'ichi remained committed to encouraging members nationwide who had suffered from priesthood-related turmoil and making a fresh start toward the 21st century.

On December 22, he attended a meeting with Odawara and Gotemba representatives at the Kanagawa Training Center in Hakone. These areas had also experienced priest-related harassment but maintained their mentor-disciple bonds.

Members sang "Mount Fuji," aspiring to the mountain's dauntless character. Shin'ichi composed poems encouraging boundless devotion to kosen-rufu. He concluded the year visiting additional Tokyo wards and Yokohama's culture center, embodying the Daishonin's teaching: unceasing effort alone opens the way forward.
