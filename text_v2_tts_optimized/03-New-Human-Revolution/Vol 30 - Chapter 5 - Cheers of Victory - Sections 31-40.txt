# Volume 30: Chapter 5, Cheers of Victory 31–40

## Overview

This chapter from *The New Human Revolution* documents Shin'ichi's visit to Oita Prefecture in December 1981, following the resolution of conflicts with dissenting priests. The narrative emphasizes leadership development, youth engagement, and the Soka Gakkai's commitment to kosen-rufu (spreading Buddhism).

## Key Themes

**Leadership and Generational Transition**
Shin'ichi addresses the need for leaders to bridge generational differences. He emphasizes that younger and senior leaders must listen to one another respectfully, with leaders acting as "orchestra conductors" who draw out everyone's strengths while maintaining organizational harmony.

**Overcoming Persecution**
The members had endured significant hardship from hostile priests. Shin'ichi reframes their suffering as a strengthening force, explaining that obstacles deepen faith and enable personal transformation. He references Buddhist teachings showing that slandering practitioners of the Mystic Law produces grave karmic consequences.

**Youth and the 21st Century**
The centerpiece is Shin'ichi's composition of an extensive poem for young division leaders titled "Youth, Scale the Mountain of Kosen-rufu of the Twenty-First Century." The poem encourages youth to embrace their mission with unwavering faith and declares May 3, 2001 as a target date for victory in the second phase of kosen-rufu.

**Correct Faith**
Shin'ichi distinguishes between false faith (exploiting the organization for personal gain), fanatical faith (disregarding reason and social norms), and correct faith, which integrates Buddhist practice with wisdom, common sense, and demonstrated social benefit.
