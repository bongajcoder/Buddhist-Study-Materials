## Great Mountain 21

Shin'ichi led the All-China Youth Federation delegation to a cherry tree planting ceremony near Soka University. Two trees were dedicated to Zhou Enlai and his wife Deng Yingchao. Delegation leader Gao Zhanxiang expressed deep emotion, reciting a poem about the sincerity and friendship represented by the trees. He later composed additional verse celebrating the enduring flower of friendship between the neighboring nations.

Shin'ichi maintained lasting friendship with Gao Zhanxiang, who became vice minister of culture. In 1992, on the 20th anniversary of China-Japan diplomatic relations, Gao presented Shin'ichi with a cultural exchange award and a calligraphy expressing their connection across waters. Gao subsequently held numerous leadership positions and authored books on culture. Between 2010 and 2012, they collaborated on a dialogue about culture's unifying power for peace.

Shin'ichi addressed Soka University's 9th entrance ceremony on April 9, emphasizing humble learning and individual worth. He quoted philosopher Georg Simmel on the difference between pride in one's inherent value and vanity based on social comparison. Later that day, he warmly welcomed the third group of Chinese students to the university's Japanese language institute.

Shin'ichi encouraged the Chinese students, noting that "the future of China and Japan rests on your shoulders." Japanese and Chinese students sang together, with their united voices symbolizing future peace. Shin'ichi envisioned this moment as representing the beacon of hope guiding toward global peace.

Deng Yingchao, widow of Premier Zhou Enlai, arrived in Japan on April 8 as head of a National People's Congress delegation. Shin'ichi met her on April 12 at the State Guesthouse, where he presented cherry blossoms she had wished to see, along with an album of photographs documenting tree plantings and Chinese students at Soka University.

Shin'ichi showed Deng Yingchao photographs documenting the memorial trees and Chinese international students. They discussed a proposed exhibition about Premier Zhou's achievements and China's Four Modernizations initiative. Their cordial conversation lasted approximately 40 minutes.

When Shin'ichi mentioned his intention to resign as Soka Gakkai president, Deng Yingchao responded firmly: "You must not retreat a single step!" Her words, spoken with the authority of a leader who had devoted her life to building the People's Republic, deeply moved him. Shin'ichi renewed his determination to work for lasting China-Japan friendship regardless of position.

Following her counsel, Shin'ichi visited China in April 1980, where Deng Yingchao hosted him and his wife Mineko at her residence in Beijing's Zhongnanhai area. He returned again in June 1984 and remained committed to China-Japan exchange even after the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident, when many nations isolated China.

In May 1990, despite international tensions following Tiananmen Square, Shin'ichi organized delegations totaling 281 Japanese members to visit China, helping reopen exchange when other groups hesitated. He and Mineko visited Deng Yingchao at her Zhongnanhai residence, where the 86-year-old, despite health challenges, presented him with Premier Zhou's ivory paper knife and her jade pen holder—gifts she considered national treasures and symbols of eternal peace and friendship.

On April 13, Shin'ichi met with Konosuke Matsushita, founder of Matsushita Electric, to discuss his resignation as Soka Gakkai president. Matsushita observed that "the most admirable life is one where you can be proud of yourself and give yourself a pat on the back." That evening, Shin'ichi traveled to the newly completed Kanagawa Culture Center in Yokohama, reflecting that this location held significance as where his mentor Josei Toda had declared for nuclear weapons abolition in 1957.

On April 14, Shin'ichi attended opening celebrations for the Kanagawa Culture Center. He reminisced about his first discussion meeting in Yokohama 30 years earlier, where five guests became members. He emphasized that conviction in the Gohonzon and genuine concern for others' happiness constitute the most powerful force in propagation. He urged members to maintain unshakeable faith through coming turning points, returning always to what founder Makiguchi termed the "stand-alone spirit" of kosen-rufu.
