# Volume 30: Chapter 3, Launching Out 41–50

## Summary

This section from *The New Human Revolution* covers events from 1980-1981, chronicling Shin'ichi Yamamoto's leadership of the Soka Gakkai during a turbulent period with Nichiren Shoshu.

## Key Themes

**Dedication to Publication and Members**
Yamamoto worked intensely to serialize *The Human Revolution* despite illness, believing the publication would inspire members. He dictated manuscripts in short bursts between rest periods, driven by commitment to his audience.

**International Expansion**
Yamamoto embarked on extensive world travels to celebrate two decades of kosen-rufu in America. His visits to Hawaii, San Francisco, Washington D.C., Chicago, and Los Angeles encompassed meetings with thousands of members and government officials. The trip demonstrated the movement's global reach across approximately 90 countries.

**Personal Transformation Stories**
The narrative highlights Sachie Perry, a Hiroshima bombing survivor who overcame domestic violence, poverty, and racial discrimination through Buddhist practice. Her family's musical performance at a Chicago culture festival exemplified how faith transforms individual lives into sources of broader social change.

**Institutional Challenge**
Internal conflict within Nichiren Shoshu intensified, with dissident priests (Shoshin-kai) attacking the Soka Gakkai despite priesthood directives for harmony. Yamamoto maintained his commitment to supporting both the lay organization and the priesthood despite mounting tension.

**Renewed Commitment**
The 50th anniversary celebration and New Year 1981 marked fresh determination to advance worldwide kosen-rufu during what the organization designated the "Year of Youth."
