# Volume 30: Chapter 6, Vow 91–100

## Vow 91
Shin'ichi Yamamoto received Colombia's Order of San Carlos and a medal from the Colombian Institute of Culture. He then traveled to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where he was met by 94-year-old Austregésilo de Athayde, president of the Brazilian Academy of Letters. Athayde had fought against dictatorship, contributed to drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights after World War II, and had long wished to meet Yamamoto after learning of his philosophy through friends and SGI members.

## Vow 92
Upon arrival, Yamamoto and Athayde embraced warmly. Athayde called Yamamoto "one of the defining figures of this century" and urged him to work together to change human history. Yamamoto responded by honoring Athayde as a comrade and friend. At an SGI-Brazil conference, Yamamoto cited his mentor Josei Toda's teaching that Buddhism requires active effort and wisdom, not passive faith alone.

## Vow 93
Yamamoto emphasized Toda's instruction that understanding worldly affairs requires continuous study and improvement. He stressed that Buddhist practitioners must "summon powerful wisdom" through practice to overcome difficulties. On February 11, the final installment of Yamamoto's 12-volume novel *The Human Revolution* was published, concluding his nearly 28-year serialization dedicated to his mentor.

## Vow 94
Yamamoto received an honorary doctorate from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. He spoke about Toda's philosophy that all people possess supreme treasures within themselves and that compassionate commitment generates limitless wisdom. He met with Athayde again and agreed to collaborate on a dialogue about human rights in the twenty-first century.

## Vow 95
Athayde expressed deep admiration for Yamamoto, saying this was the first time in his nearly 100 years he had wanted to meet someone as much. He called Yamamoto "a person who is changing the history of humankind." Their spirits resonated as they discussed using "noble words as our supreme weapon" to advance human rights and usher in a new age.

## Vow 96
Yamamoto became the first Japanese and first Asian appointed as a foreign associate member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters, joining distinguished figures like Tolstoy and Zola. He received the Machado de Assis Medal, the academy's highest honor. In his lecture, he argued that spiritually-grounded religion would form the backbone of global civilization in the twenty-first century.

## Vow 97
Yamamoto traveled to Argentina on February 14. Athayde continued their dialogue through correspondence despite illness, recording responses about human rights before his death on September 13, 1993, just before turning 95. Their dialogue was later published as *Human Rights in the Twenty-First Century*. In Argentina, Yamamoto met with former presidential secretary Alberto Kohan and attended an SGI conference with youth preparing for an international peace culture festival.

## Vow 98
Speaking to Argentine members, Yamamoto emphasized that Nichiren Buddhism teaches equality and encompasses all people across time and geography. He introduced Argentine poet Almafuerte's saying: "Sometimes a great destiny sleeps to be awakened by anguish." Yamamoto taught that suffering becomes a springboard to enlightenment when people actively overcome challenges with wisdom and determination.

## Vow 99
Yamamoto met with Argentine President Carlos Menem and emphasized the importance of global unity and cultural flourishing in the twenty-first century. Young Argentine women of Japanese descent, educated at national and Japanese universities on government scholarships, served as official SGI interpreters. Their childhood participation in Soka Gakkai activities had inspired lifelong dedication to spreading the organization's mission.

## Vow 100
The Argentine Senate and Chamber of Deputies honored Yamamoto for his peace efforts. A legislative bill based partly on Yamamoto's 1983 peace proposal had established a "Peace Day" and mandated peace education in schools. Senate leaders acknowledged his insight that "peace is not simply the absence of war" but requires respecting human dignity. Yamamoto received honorary degrees and honorary professorships, while ten cities presented him with keys or plaques.
