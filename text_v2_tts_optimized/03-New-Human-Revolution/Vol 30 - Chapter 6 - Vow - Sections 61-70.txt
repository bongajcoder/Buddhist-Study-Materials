# Volume 30: Chapter 6, Vow 61–70

## Vow 61

Japanese author Hidehiko Ushijima argued that culture and religion maintain distinct roles. He contended that dismissing works like Beethoven's Ninth Symphony as heretical reflects dogmatism that undermines religious practice. Ushijima warned that Nichiren Shoshu's rigid approach would prevent global propagation of Buddhist teachings.

The Soka Gakkai observed troubling patterns among Nichiren Shoshu priests: idle behavior, lack of missionary commitment, and extravagant lifestyles. Second president Josei Toda had previously warned against priests prioritizing status and wealth over spiritual work.

## Vow 62

On January 3, 1991, the Soka Gakkai presented three requests to Nichiren Shoshu: adopting democratic values, respecting lay believers as equals rather than subordinates, and addressing clerical corruption. Shin'ichi Yamamoto encouraged members to pursue these reforms while maintaining steadfast faith.

That month, Yamamoto issued a peace proposal addressing the Gulf War, calling for UN-led resolution. The SGI Asia Council adopted an urgent appeal supporting these peace initiatives, demonstrating how faith motivates commitment to global harmony.

## Vow 63

Yamamoto continued extensive travel promoting cultural and educational exchange. He visited the University of East Asia in Macau, delivered lectures in the Philippines and Harvard University, and toured Japanese regions encouraging members.

Meanwhile, Nichiren Shoshu announced policy changes ending official recognition of overseas lay organizations and restricting pilgrimages to their head temple. This represented a dramatic reversal after decades of Soka Gakkai support.

## Vow 64

The Soka Gakkai had substantially invested in Taiseki-ji temple development. During Toda's presidency and Yamamoto's tenure, they donated multiple buildings and facilities. Over four decades, members made approximately 70 million pilgrimages, generating crucial financial support that helped the temple recover from postwar agricultural reforms.

In July 1991, Nichiren Shoshu mandated that lay believers register as temple parishioners, explicitly attempting to force Soka Gakkai members to abandon their organization. This represented one of Buddhism's gravest transgressions: "causing disunity and disorder in the community of believers."

## Vow 65

Yamamoto maintained his global engagement schedule while navigating organizational challenges. He lectured on "soft power," promoted cultural exchange, and met international leaders. Through these efforts and personal member engagement, he built mentor-disciple bonds strengthened by shared commitment to kosen-rufu.

As priesthood conflicts intensified, members developed clearer understanding of their mission, recognizing that attacks validated their Buddhist practice according to Nichiren's own teachings about persecution.

## Vow 66

Yamamoto consistently returned to foundational Buddhist principles during member meetings. He referenced Charlie Chaplin's courage and Victor Hugo's advocacy for justice, connecting these to Nichiren's humanistic vision. He emphasized that attacks on the Soka Gakkai matched patterns described in Daishonin's writings, validating their mission.

Satellite video broadcasts beginning in 1989 unified the nationwide membership, allowing members to witness Yamamoto's commitment and deepen their understanding of doctrinal issues through direct dialogue.

## Vow 67

On November 8, 1991, Nichiren Shoshu issued a "Remonstrance to the Soka Gakkai to Disband," claiming lay believers must revere priests as teachers. However, the Soka Gakkai had established legal independence in 1952, so Nichiren Shoshu possessed no authority to compel dissolution.

Members recognized the priesthood's hypocrisy. In September 1991, it emerged that High Priest Nikken had conducted ceremonies at a Zen temple cemetery—an act contradicting his accusations against the Soka Gakkai.

## Vow 68

Soka Gakkai leaders held a press conference rejecting Nichiren Shoshu's demands, detailing the priesthood's authoritarianism and intolerance. Members began collecting petition signatures calling for Nikken's resignation.

The situation paralleled medieval European clerical corruption, where funeral rites and memorial practices were exploited financially. Members increasingly questioned whether such practices aligned with genuine Buddhism.

## Vow 69

The Soka Gakkai reexamined funeral practices through Nichiren's original teachings. The Daishonin states that practitioners attain Buddhahood through their lifetime faith and chanting, requiring no priestly intermediation. Posthumous Buddhist names originated centuries after Nichiren's era and carry no doctrinal significance regarding Buddhahood attainment.

The Soka Gakkai developed lay-conducted funerals reflecting this understanding. Observers praised these ceremonies as "inspiring and buoyant," noting they conveyed "hope toward the deceased's departure," embodying positive Buddhist perspectives on life and death.

## Vow 70

Scholars described Soka Gakkai lay funerals as "a revolutionary change in Japanese funeral practices," noting their progressive nature might face resistance but represented "the funerals of the future."

The Heisei Reformation emerged as members championed humanistic Nichiren Buddhism principles. Nearly 5 million petition signatures demanding Nikken's resignation were collected within ten days. Members recognized the appearance of the "third powerful enemy"—corrupt high priests—as validation that they were practicing authentic Lotus Sutra Buddhism as Nichiren predicted.
