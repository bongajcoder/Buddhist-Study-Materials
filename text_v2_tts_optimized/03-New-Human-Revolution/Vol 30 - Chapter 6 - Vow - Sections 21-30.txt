The 1982 Falkland Islands conflict between the UK and Argentina lasted several weeks with over 900 casualties. Despite their nations' military opposition, SGI-UK and SGI-Argentina leaders—who had trained together in Japan—chanted jointly for peace.

Shin'ichi Yamamoto believed grassroots kosen-rufu activities, rooted in ordinary people's lives, created foundations for lasting peace. He engaged with world leaders while prioritizing educational exchanges with universities, recognizing that student networks would become forces for global unity.

Between 1983-1984, Yamamoto visited the United States, Europe, and South America. He returned to Brazil after 18 years, meeting President João Figueiredo on February 21, 1984, in Brasília. Previously, Brazil's military government had denied his visa application due to misunderstandings about the Soka Gakkai.

Gorbachev responded warmly, expressing respect for Yamamoto's humanistic work. Yamamoto noted that twenty-five years earlier he had proposed "humanistic socialism," which paralleled Gorbachev's vision of "socialism with a human face," both grounded in shared humanity.

## Vow 30

Gorbachev praised Yamamoto's "intellectual and social activities" and peace movement, emphasizing their "spiritual aspect." Both leaders discussed integrating morality and ethics into governance, the alliance of politics and culture, Soviet-Japan relations, perestroika's significance, and hopes for youth.

Yamamoto invited Gorbachev to visit Japan, mentioning Japanese women's hopes he would visit "in the spring when the cherry trees are in bloom, or in the fall when the autumn leaves are so lovely." Gorbachev agreed enthusiastically, committing to spring travel and opening "the doors to a new age."
