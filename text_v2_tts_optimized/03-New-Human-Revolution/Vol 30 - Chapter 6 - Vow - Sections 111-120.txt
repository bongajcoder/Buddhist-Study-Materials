# Volume 30: Chapter 6, Vow 111–120

## Vow 111
Shin'ichi Yamamoto attended a Soka Family Gathering in Chile where members sang passionately about welcoming travelers. On February 25, 1993, he met with Chilean President Patricio Aylwin at the presidential palace, continuing a dialogue that had begun in Tokyo the previous year. Their conversation focused on leadership, democracy, and cultural exchange. Yamamoto presented Aylwin with a poem celebrating the president's commitment to democracy, emphasizing that "the power of reason and the spirit" ultimately enriches humanity more than force.

Aylwin later visited Japan in July 1994 and lectured at Soka University. Their three meetings formed the basis for a published dialogue collection. In February 1993, Yamamoto attended the 16th SGI General Meeting in São Paulo, Brazil, with representatives from 32 countries. He encouraged members to be pioneers of worldwide kosen-rufu and to illuminate their communities with humanity's light. Subsequently, Yamamoto traveled extensively—to Miami, San Francisco, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Canada, Russia, and Europe—devoting himself to building foundations for global peace efforts.

On January 1, 1995 (designated as the Year of Glory and Advancement), Yamamoto led a New Year's meeting at Soka Gakkai Headquarters. On Coming-of-Age Day, he addressed women's division leaders about needed qualities in 21st-century leaders: "sincerity," honesty, kindness, responsibility, conviction, and approachability. He emphasized that Buddhist practice requires "real wisdom and concrete action," not ideas alone.

Two days later, on January 17, a devastating earthquake struck west-central Japan, killing approximately 6,400 people. Known as the Great Hanshin Earthquake, it caused widespread destruction in Kobe, Awaji Island, and surrounding areas. Yamamoto immediately mobilized Soka Gakkai resources for rescue and relief efforts.

Soka Gakkai facilities became evacuation and relief centers. Members formed motorcycle corps to deliver emergency supplies through debris-blocked streets. Though Yamamoto had planned to travel to Hawaii for a lecture, he delayed his departure to coordinate response efforts. He instructed leaders traveling to the disaster area to convey a message of faith to bereaved members: "the good fortune and benefit we accumulate through our Buddhist practice will endure eternally." He encouraged survivors to transform their suffering through faith, citing the principle of "changing poison into medicine."

On January 26, Yamamoto traveled to Hawaii and delivered a lecture at the East-West Center titled "Peace and Human Security: A Buddhist Perspective for the Twenty-first Century," commemorating the UN's 50th anniversary. He argued that peace requires human revolution—inner transformation—rather than focusing solely on institutional reform. He proposed a fundamental shift in thinking "from knowledge to wisdom, from uniformity to diversity, and from national sovereignty to human sovereignty."

He reunited with scholars John Montgomery, Glenn Paige, and Johan Galtung while participating in peace and culture conferences. On February 2, he returned to Japan and immediately traveled to Kansai to attend memorial services and encourage earthquake survivors, emphasizing that departed members would return to support kosen-rufu efforts.

From late October 1995, Yamamoto visited four Asian countries and territories, including Nepal—his 51st country visited for peace. On November 1, he met with King Birendra at the royal palace. The following day, he delivered a commencement address at Tribhuvan University titled "Homage to the Sagarmatha of Humanism," discussing Buddha's wisdom and compassion. The university awarded him an honorary Doctor of Letters degree.

Later, Yamamoto traveled by car to view the Himalayas. As clouds parted momentarily at sunset, snow-covered peaks appeared magnificently. A group of Nepalese children approached him curiously. He encouraged them, noting they lived in an amazing place and could become great people, urging them to visit Japan when older.

Yamamoto told the children they lived in "an amazing place" where Buddha was born and grew up watching the Himalayas. He encouraged each child to strive to become "a mighty champion" like Buddha. The following day, he attended SGI-Nepal's first General Meeting with over 100 members, urging them to "advance together in harmony and friendship."

Yamamoto then traveled to Singapore for the 3rd SGI Asia Culture and Education Conference and visited the Singapore Soka Kindergarten. He participated in Singapore's Friendship Youth Arts Festival celebrating 30 years of the nation's founding.

On November 10, Yamamoto arrived in Hong Kong, a British territory scheduled to return to Chinese rule in 1997. Hong Kong residents faced uncertainty about their future under Communist governance, causing economic anxiety and mass emigration. During his December 1983 visit, Yamamoto had told members there was "absolutely no need for you to worry," urging them to live confidently and declaring they would "create a record of victory together that will endure forever."

The 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration promised Hong Kong would become a special administrative region maintaining a free capitalist economy under "one nation, two systems" for 50 years. Despite this assurance, residents remained anxious.

During his November 1995 Hong Kong visit, Yamamoto met with Jin Yong (pen name of Louis Cha), a famous writer, newspaper founder, and member of the committee drafting Hong Kong's post-handover Basic Law. Yamamoto expressed certainty that Hong Kong would "continue to prosper after its return to China," adding that spiritual fulfillment would complement economic development. Jin Yong responded: "I hope that SGI–Hong Kong...will communicate the importance of spiritual values...to many people."

On July 1, 1997, Hong Kong was handed to China. SGI-Hong Kong members performed at celebrations and resolved to make post-handover Hong Kong "a harbor of peace and prosperity." Yamamoto also visited Macau, receiving an honorary doctorate and meeting municipal officials there.

Soka Gakkai International was founded January 26, 1975, at a conference in Guam. By its 20th anniversary in 1995, SGI organizations had established trust worldwide. A committee drafted an SGI Charter clarifying the organization's aims and conduct guidelines. The 10-article Charter committed SGI to peace, culture, education, human rights, environmental protection, and character cultivation.

Article 7 emphasized respecting other religions and engaging in dialogue. The Charter reflected the conviction that world peace requires people to "join hands and strive together with an awareness that they share a common destiny," transcending religious, nationalistic, and ethnic differences. During the 1995 earthquake, SGI organizations worldwide offered support, and they collaborated with other religious groups on nuclear abolition efforts.
