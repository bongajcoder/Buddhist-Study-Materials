# Volume 30: Chapter 6, Vow 71–80

## Summary of Content

This section documents pivotal events in Soka Gakkai history during late 1991 and early 1992, focusing on the organization's separation from Nichiren Shoshu and its emergence as an independent religious movement.

## Key Events

**The Excommunication (November 1991)**
Nichiren Shoshu issued a formal excommunication notice against the Soka Gakkai after the lay organization refused compliance with previous demands. The priesthood simultaneously excommunicated all SGI organizations worldwide.

Senior Soka Gakkai leaders, including Hiroshi Izumida, responded by exposing the priesthood's corruption and authoritarian practices. Izumida criticized Nichiren Shoshu's historical compromises, stating that "they accepted the Shinto talisman" and manipulated believers by withholding religious objects.

**International Recognition**
On the same day the excommunication arrived, the Association of African Heads of Mission honored SGI President Shin'ichi Yamamoto with a Certificate of Appreciation for his contributions to "world peace through education, culture" and human rights advocacy.

**Leadership Response**
Soka Gakkai President Eisuke Akizuki declared that "Nichiren Shoshu...has degenerated into the 'Nikken sect'" and proclaimed the organization's "spiritual independence." Members responded with jubilation, recognizing November 28 as a historic date marking their autonomous path forward.

**Institutional Developments**
The organization established ceremonies divisions throughout Japan and presented a petition bearing over 16 million signatures calling for High Priest Nikken's resignation.

Members celebrated with cultural festivals and music performances throughout late 1991, advancing toward the 21st century with renewed commitment to global propagation of Buddhist teachings.
