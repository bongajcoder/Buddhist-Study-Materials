# Volume 30: Chapter 3, Launching Out 31–40

## Launching Out 31
Shin'ichi addressed young men's division leaders in Osaka on May 5, encouraging them to maintain steadfast faith through life's challenges. He emphasized that consistent chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo brings good fortune and personal growth. Later, he spoke to young women's division leaders, urging them to view faith as never abandoning the Gohonzon, regardless of circumstances.

## Launching Out 32
Shin'ichi met with members of Tetsujin-kai, a stage crew group. They had crafted a chair for his use, and he expressed deep appreciation for their sincere gesture and behind-the-scenes support. He later addressed the Kansai Comrades-in-Faith Group, describing truly capable individuals as those awakened to their mission as Bodhisattvas of the Earth.

## Launching Out 33
On May 6, Shin'ichi conducted three gongyo meetings at the Kansai Culture Center. To women's division members, he taught that "happiness is found in your immediate environment" and that problems nourish happiness. He instructed the men's division that their chanting reverberates throughout the universe. Additional gongyo sessions were added due to overwhelming member attendance.

## Launching Out 34
After seven days in Kansai, Shin'ichi had encouraged over 70,000 members. He reflected on a 1969 visit when he had nursed a high fever but continued guiding members in Wakayama, expending all his strength. He departed for Nagoya on May 8, carrying forward the selfless spirit needed to fulfill kosen-rufu's great vow.

## Launching Out 35
In Nagoya, long lines formed at the Chubu Culture Center. Shin'ichi held five gongyo sessions that morning despite a sore throat, meeting with hundreds of members. He continued through afternoon and evening sessions, meeting people even after 10 p.m. In Gifu Prefecture, he met a nearly 100-year-old pioneer member and presented her with carnations on Mother's Day.

## Launching Out 36
At the Kakamigahara Culture Center, Shin'ichi climbed the spiral fire escape to enter the overcrowded building. He told members "everything's all right now! You've won" and played piano for them. During his Chubu visit, he participated in over 100 group photo sessions and proposed that nineteen members at a train station be known as the Hashima Group.

## Launching Out 37
Shin'ichi returned to Tokyo on May 14 after visiting Nagasaki, Fukuoka, Osaka, Aichi, Gifu, and Shizuoka prefectures, encouraging over 150,000 members. He focused on rebuilding the Tokyo organization while contending with organizational crises. Tomomasa Yamawaki, facing massive business debts, had become involved in extortion schemes and was manipulating young priests antagonistic to the Soka Gakkai.

## Launching Out 38
Yamawaki had collaborated with Takao Harayama, the Study Department leader, who photocopied documents from the Seikyo Shimbun Building in September 1979. Yamawaki used these materials to drive wedges between the priesthood and Gakkai. In April 1980, he began extorting money, eventually demanding 300 million yen, then 500 million yen.

## Launching Out 39
On June 7, the Gakkai filed an extortion complaint against Yamawaki. That same day, anti-Gakkai priest candidates won ten of sixteen Council seats. The following month, young priests formed the Shoshin-kai organization and attacked the Gakkai during temple lectures despite administrative directives to cease. Members endured media attacks while continuing their faith practice.

## Launching Out 40
Toward July's end, Shin'ichi met with Seikyo Shimbun editors regarding his new essay series "Unforgettable Friends in Faith" and the resumption of his serialized novel, The Human Revolution. Despite concerns about priest opposition, he resolved to resume writing to inspire members facing persecution. He declared his responsibility was "to protect the children of the Buddha, our members."
