# Chapter 4: Nichiren Daishonin and the Lotus Sutra

## 1. The Lotus Sutra

The Lotus Sutra represents a fundamental shift in Buddhist philosophy, teaching that all people possess inherent buddha nature and can achieve enlightenment. Before this scripture, Buddhist teachings suggested ordinary people could not attain buddhahood within a single lifetime, requiring instead numerous rebirths of practice to purify themselves.

The Lotus Sutra overturned this perspective, revealing that buddhahood already exists within everyone's life and can be manifested immediately by awakening to this truth.

### The True Aspect of All Phenomena

Central to the Lotus Sutra's theoretical teaching is the principle that all phenomena—the world around us and its workings—possess an ultimate reality. This true aspect refers to the deepest essential nature of existence. According to Nichiren Daishonin's interpretation, all beings across the Ten Worlds and their environments are manifestations of Myoho-renge-kyo, the Mystic Law.

This teaching eliminates the perceived gap between buddhas and ordinary people. While they may appear different in roles and behavior, on the fundamental level of life itself, they are essentially identical. Beings in any of the nine worlds can therefore achieve buddhahood.

The Lotus Sutra further guarantees enlightenment for groups previously denied this possibility: people of the two vehicles (voice-hearers and cause-awakened ones), evil people, and women.

### Shakyamuni's Attainment in the Remote Past

The essential teaching of the Lotus Sutra reveals that Shakyamuni attained enlightenment in the remote past—not for the first time during his lifetime in India. The "Life Span" chapter describes this as occurring "numberless major world system dust particle kalpas" ago, establishing Shakyamuni as an eternal buddha always present in the world.

This revelation means buddhahood and the nine worlds coexist eternally within Shakyamuni's life. He embodies the mutual possession of the Ten Worlds, demonstrating that one life state contains all others simultaneously.

### The Bodhisattvas of the Earth

The Lotus Sutra depicts countless bodhisattvas emerging from beneath the earth, tasked with propagating the Buddha's teaching in the evil age following his passing. Led by four bodhisattvas—Superior Practices, Boundless Practices, Pure Practices, and Firmly Established Practices—these enlightened beings possess the same wisdom as Shakyamuni.

Nichiren Daishonin clarifies that these bodhisattvas appear in the Latter Day of the Law to spread Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. The Daishonin himself fulfilled this role, appearing as a Bodhisattva of the Earth to teach the Mystic Law. Daishonin states: "If you are of the same mind as Nichiren, you must be a Bodhisattva of the Earth."

All who accept, believe in, and propagate the Daishonin's teachings become Bodhisattvas of the Earth themselves, serving as genuine disciples continuing Shakyamuni's mission.

### Bodhisattva Never Disparaging

The twentieth chapter of the Lotus Sutra presents Bodhisattva Never Disparaging as a model practitioner. This bodhisattva venerates everyone encountered, regardless of their actions, bowing respectfully and reciting the twenty-four-character Lotus Sutra: "I have profound reverence for you, I would never dare treat you with disparagement or arrogance. Why? Because you will all practice the bodhisattva way and will then be able to attain buddhahood."

Despite facing attacks from arrogant people, Never Disparaging persists in showing respect, embodying the Lotus Sutra's core teaching that all people inherently possess buddha nature.

The Daishonin emphasizes this practice's importance: "The heart of the practice of the Lotus Sutra is found in the 'Never Disparaging' chapter." He identifies this as Buddhism's highest ethical conduct—respecting oneself and others based on recognition of universal buddha nature.

## 2. Nichiren Daishonin and the Lotus Sutra

Nichiren Daishonin lived the Lotus Sutra's predictions, facing persecutions exactly as the scripture foretold would occur to its true practitioners in the Latter Day of the Law.

### The Votary of the Lotus Sutra in the Latter Day of the Law

The Lotus Sutra warns that those spreading its teaching after Shakyamuni's passing will encounter "hatred and jealousy," describing this opposition as inevitable. The scripture outlines six difficult acts—including propagating, copying, reciting, teaching, hearing, and maintaining faith in the sutra—emphasizing how challenging these endeavors prove in the age after the Buddha's passing.

The sutra identifies three categories of opponents—the "three powerful enemies": arrogant laypeople, arrogant priests, and arrogant false sages. All three persecuted the Daishonin as predicted.

Arrogant laypeople attacked him physically. Buddhist clergy clung to shallow interpretations and slandered him. High-ranking priests like Ryokan used their influence to orchestrate persecution. The Daishonin faced attempted execution at Tatsunokuchi and exile to both Ito and Sado Island—confirming his role as the sutra's true votary.

By reading the Lotus Sutra with his very life, manifesting its predictions through his experiences, Nichiren Daishonin proved the scripture's validity and Shakyamuni's prophetic wisdom.

### Bodhisattva Superior Practices

Nichiren Daishonin's mission aligned with that of Bodhisattva Superior Practices, whom Shakyamuni entrusted with spreading the Lotus Sutra in the Latter Day of the Law. The "Supernatural Powers" and "Emerging from the Earth" chapters compare Superior Practices to the sun, moon, and lotus flower—illuminating darkness and remaining unsullied by this impure world.

The Daishonin chose the name "Nichiren" (sun lotus) to express his conviction of fulfilling Superior Practices' role. Beyond his visible actions, however, Daishonin possessed the enlightened life state of the eternal buddha of limitless joy.

He manifested this buddhahood through the Gohonzon—a mandala representing the object of devotion for all Latter Day people seeking enlightenment. Modeled after the Ceremony in the Air from the Lotus Sutra, the Gohonzon embodies Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.

By believing in the Gohonzon and chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, practitioners reveal their inherent buddhahood. Like Nichiren Daishonin, they manifest the Mystic Law in daily life and society, enjoying the benefit and good fortune accompanying this enlightened state.
