# Chapter 1: Nichiren Daishonin's Life and Teachings

## 1. The Life of Nichiren Daishonin

### Early Years

Nichiren Daishonin was born February 16, 1222, in a coastal hamlet in Awa Province (modern-day Chiba Prefecture). His family earned their livelihood through fishing. At age 12, he began studies at Seichoji temple, vowing to become the wisest person in Japan to understand Buddhist teachings and lead people to happiness.

At 16, he formally entered the priesthood under Dozen-bo's instruction. He later traveled to major Buddhist centers including Mount Hiei, studying sutras and temple doctrines across Japan. Through this education, he confirmed that the Lotus Sutra was supreme and that Nam-myoho-renge-kyo—the Mystic Law—represented its essence and the means for people in the Latter Day of the Law to attain enlightenment.

### The Declaration of His Teaching

On April 28, 1253, at Seichoji temple, the 32-year-old Nichiren publicly refuted the Nembutsu and other teachings as erroneous, proclaiming Nam-myoho-renge-kyo as the sole correct Buddhist teaching for the Latter Day of the Law. This declaration established his teaching and marked when he adopted the name Nichiren.

His denunciation angered local steward Tojo Kagenobu, an ardent Nembutsu believer who planned an armed attack. The Daishonin escaped and relocated to Kamakura, where he began earnest propagation efforts while refuting prevalent erroneous teachings.

### Submitting the Treatise and Early Persecutions

Japan experienced devastating natural disasters during the 1250s-1260s. Prompted by the destructive 1257 earthquake in Kamakura, Nichiren wrote "On Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land," submitted to retired regent Hojo Tokiyori on July 16, 1260.

In this treatise, he declared that successive calamities resulted from people slandering correct Buddhist teaching and relying on erroneous doctrines, particularly the Nembutsu teaching. He warned that continued reliance on false teachings would bring internal strife and foreign invasion—calamities yet to occur.

Authorities ignored his remonstration. Soon after submission, Nembutsu believers stormed his dwelling attempting to kill him—the Matsubagayatsu Persecution. He escaped unharmed but left Kamakura temporarily.

On May 12, 1261, he was arrested and exiled to Ito in Izu Province. After pardoning in February 1263, he returned to Kamakura. In 1264, visiting his ailing mother in Awa, he was ambushed at Matsubara by armed men under Tojo Kagenobu's command, suffering serious injuries in what became known as the Komatsubara Persecution.

### The Tatsunokuchi Persecution

In 1268, the Mongol Empire demanded Japan become a tributary, making foreign invasion a real threat. Nichiren wrote eleven remonstrative letters to government officials and Buddhist leaders, reminding them of his earlier predictions and proposing public debates.

Government and religious authorities rejected his appeals. Around this time, True Word priests gained influence through government-sponsored prayers against Mongol forces. Ryokan of Gokurakuji temple, a True Word Precepts priest, became increasingly influential.

Nichiren challenged Ryokan to produce rain within seven days or acknowledge the Lotus Sutra's superiority. When prayers failed and fierce winds arose instead, Ryokan lost face. Rather than accepting defeat, Ryokan used his government connections to have the Daishonin persecuted.

On September 10, 1271, Hei no Saemon-no-jo interrogated and admonished the Daishonin. Two days later, armed soldiers arrested him. That night, he was taken to Tatsunokuchi beach for secret execution.

As the executioner raised his sword, a brilliant orb of light burst from nearby Enoshima island, terrifying soldiers and halting the execution attempt. This became the Tatsunokuchi Persecution.

This event held profound significance: Nichiren triumphed over death, casting off his transient status as an ordinary, karma-burdened person and revealing his true identity as an eternal Buddha possessing infinite wisdom and compassion. Thereafter, he inscribed the Gohonzon as the fundamental object of devotion for all people.

### The Sado Exile

Following the Tatsunokuchi Persecution, Nichiren was housed at Homma Shigetsura's residence in Sagami Province while the government deliberated his fate. His Kamakura followers suffered persecutions including false accusations of arson and murder.

Eventually sentenced to exile on Sado Island, he departed October 10 and arrived November 1 at Tsukahara. His assigned dwelling was a small, dilapidated hut formerly used for funerary rites. Conditions were harsh: bitter cold, insufficient food and clothing, and hostile Nembutsu followers seeking his death.

Most of his remaining followers abandoned faith from fear. However, on January 16-17, 1272, several hundred Buddhist priests gathered intending to kill him. Homma Shigetsura proposed a religious debate instead. The Daishonin thoroughly refuted erroneous teachings in what became the Tsukahara Debate.

In February 1272, a Hojo clan faction rebelled, causing fighting in Kamakura and Kyoto—the Disturbance of the Second Month. This internal strife occurred just 150 days after Nichiren's prediction during the Tatsunokuchi Persecution.

During exile, Nikko Shonin faithfully served him and shared his sufferings. Nichiren steadily gained followers including Abutsu-bo and his wife, the lay nun Sennichi.

He composed significant works during Sado exile, particularly "The Opening of the Eyes" (February 1272) and "The Object of Devotion for Observing the Mind" (April 1273). These works explained his role as the Latter Day votary of the Lotus Sutra and presented the object of devotion for all people.

Pardoned in February 1274, he departed Sado in March and returned to Kamakura. Meeting Hei no Saemon-no-jo in April, he remonstrated against government-sponsored prayers to False teachings and predicted a Mongol invasion before year's end.

A large Mongol fleet attacked Kyushu in October 1274—the first Mongol invasion. Both predictions from "On Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land" (internal strife and foreign invasion) had materialized. The Daishonin had now made three remonstrations with government authorities, all of which proved accurate.

### Mount Minobu Residence

When government rejected his final remonstration, Nichiren relocated to Hakii Village on Mount Minobu's slopes in Kai Province (modern Yamanashi Prefecture). Local steward Hakii Sanenaga, converted through Nikko Shonin's efforts, became his follower.

Moving to Mount Minobu in May 1274, Nichiren did not retreat from society. He composed major works including "The Selection of the Time" and "On Repaying Debts of Gratitude," elucidating the Three Great Secret Laws: the object of devotion, sanctuary, and daimoku of the essential teaching.

Through Lotus Sutra lectures, he fostered disciples for future kosen-rufu propagation. He also wrote numerous letters to lay followers nationwide, patiently instructing and encouraging them toward strong faith, life victory, and buddhahood.

### The Atsuhara Persecution

After Nichiren relocated to Mount Minobu, Nikko Shonin actively propagated in the Fuji area, converting many Tendai priests and followers. Local Tendai temples responded with harassment and threats against converts.

On September 21, 1279, twenty Atsuhara farmers following the Daishonin were arrested on false charges and brought to Kamakura. At Hei no Saemon-no-jo's residence, they endured torture-equivalent interrogation. Though pressured to abandon Lotus Sutra faith, all remained steadfast.

Three farmers—brothers Jinshiro, Yagoro, and Yarokuro—were executed; seventeen others were banished. This Atsuhara Persecution demonstrated that humble, ordinary people had developed sufficiently strong faith to withstand severe persecution.

In "On Persecutions Befalling the Sage" (October 1, 1279), Nichiren referenced the purpose of his appearance in this world. His youthful vow to become wise and free all people from fundamental suffering found fulfillment: ordinary people embracing Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and the Three Great Secret Laws dedicated themselves to kosen-rufu without begrudging their lives, demonstrating that his Buddhism was a teaching for all humanity's enlightenment.

During this persecution, his follower Nanjo Tokimitsu, a village steward, worked tirelessly protecting believers, embodying the united spirit of many in body, one in mind.

### Death and Succession

On September 8, 1282, declining in health, Nichiren left Mount Minobu intending to visit therapeutic hot springs in Hitachi Province. He reached follower Ikegami Munenaka's residence in Musashi Province (modern Tokyo) and began arranging affairs.

On September 25, despite grave illness, he lectured followers on "On Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land." He passed away October 13, 1282, at age 61, concluding his noble life as the Lotus Sutra votary.

Only Nikko Shonin continued his fearless spirit and kosen-rufu actions after his death. Nikko treasured the Daishonin's writings as sacred scripture for the Latter Day, calling them "honorable writings" (gosho). He fostered many outstanding disciples committed to Buddhist practice and study.

## 2. Nam-myoho-renge-kyo

Nam-myoho-renge-kyo represents Buddhism's essence and the fundamental Law that Nichiren Daishonin perceived for resolving all humanity's suffering.

### The Fundamental Law

Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is the fundamental Law pervading the entire universe and all life. Shakyamuni Buddha, viewing all people's sufferings as his own, searched for resolution. He awakened to the eternal, all-pervading, fundamental Law existing within his being, becoming known as the awakened one.

Nichiren Daishonin identified this Law—which resolves human suffering fundamentally and opens the way to genuine happiness—as Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.

Buddhas embody the Law in their lives, overcome all suffering, and establish unshakable inner absolute happiness. Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is the essential principle for attaining buddhahood.

Buddhas awaken to the truth that this all-pervasive Law exists in all people's lives, transcending life and death bounds, never lost or destroyed. Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is universal and eternal, persisting through past, present, and future.

### Profound Meaning in the Name

Myoho-renge-kyo is the Lotus Sutra's full Japanese title, translating as "the Lotus Sutra of the wonderful [mystic] law."

Because the Law in the Lotus Sutra is difficult to fathom, it's called the Mystic Law (myoho). The lotus metaphor describes the Mystic Law's distinctive characteristics: though growing in muddy water, lotuses remain unsullied, producing pure, fragrant blooms—symbolizing those with Mystic Law faith living in suffering-rife worlds while remaining pure, teaching and guiding others to enlightenment.

Additionally, lotuses uniquely contain seed pods within buds, with flowers and fruit appearing simultaneously. This illustrates that buddhahood, though indiscernible, exists in ordinary people's lives before manifestation, and becoming a buddha doesn't eliminate ordinary life states.

Kyo (sutra) indicates the Lotus Sutra contains eternal truth—the Mystic Law—and people should venerate it. Nam (namu), rendering Sanskrit namas, means bow or reverence. It was also translated as dedicating one's life, meaning devoting oneself body and mind to the Law, practicing and embodying it entirely.

Nam-myoho-renge-kyo expresses the Buddha's very heart and essence through wise and compassionate action leading all people to enlightenment.

### Nichiren Daishonin's Enlightened State

Although the Lotus Sutra teaches the fundamental universal Law, it doesn't reveal its exact nature or name. Nichiren Daishonin awakened to this Law existing in his own life, revealing it as Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.

Nam-myoho-renge-kyo isn't simply the Lotus Sutra title prefaced by "nam," but the Law's actual name. By revealing this, the Daishonin fundamentally opened the way for freeing people from suffering and delusion arising from their lives' true nature ignorance, helping them build unshakable happiness.

This is why we revere Nichiren Daishonin as the Latter Day Buddha, an age filled with confusion and suffering. Nam-myoho-renge-kyo represents his enlightened buddhahood state—his true identity—embodying the Law pervading universe and existence.

Ordinary people are themselves the Mystic Law. The buddhahood life state is inherent in unenlightened ordinary people's lives—in everyone. All people are inherently and originally Nam-myoho-renge-kyo itself.

However, ignorant of this truth, ordinary people cannot demonstrate the Mystic Law's power and functions within them. Buddha awareness means awakening to this truth; unenlightened status means doubting or unawareness. When practicing Nam-myoho-renge-kyo with faith, the Mystic Law's power activates in our lives, manifesting buddhahood.

### The Gohonzon Object of Devotion

Nichiren Daishonin depicted his buddhahood—enlightened life state—as a mandala, making it the object of devotion (gohonzon) for Buddhist practice. This allows ordinary people manifesting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo in their lives and attaining buddhahood like him.

The Daishonin teaches: "Never seek this Gohonzon outside yourself. The Gohonzon exists only within the mortal flesh of us ordinary people who embrace the Lotus Sutra and chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo."

Revering Nam-myoho-renge-kyo—the fundamental Law and buddhahood life state embodied in the Gohonzon—believing it's inherent in our own lives allows us tapping the Mystic Law within and manifesting our buddhahood.

_The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings_ states: "Great joy [is what] one experiences when one understands for the first time that one's mind from the very beginning has been a buddha. Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is the greatest of all joys."

Realizing we are inherent buddhas and Nam-myoho-renge-kyo itself brings forth wonderful benefit and good fortune beyond measure. This represents life's greatest joy. Triumphing over hardships through Mystic Law practice creates lives of unsurpassed joy while developing eternally indestructible happiness.

## 3. Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime and Kosen-rufu

### Attaining Buddhahood

Buddhahood is the awakening state buddhas attain, often called enlightenment—perfect freedom characterized by eternal and ultimate truth awareness, boundless wisdom, infinite compassion, and undaunted courage.

Our Buddhist faith and practice's fundamental purpose is attaining buddhahood's life state. Practicing Nichiren Daishonin's Buddhism aims at individual buddhahood attainment in this lifetime while securing others' happiness.

By embracing Gohonzon faith and striving sincerely in Buddhist practice for oneself and others, anyone can realize buddhahood in this existence. This principle is called "attaining buddhahood in this lifetime."

Self-practice means Buddhist practice for personal benefit. Other-practice means teaching and guiding others to Buddhist practice so they experience benefit. Specifically, this involves performing gongyo and chanting daimoku (Nam-myoho-renge-kyo) while reaching out discussing Buddhism, teaching and guiding others, thereby propagating the Mystic Law.

Nichiren Daishonin wrote: "If votaries of the Lotus Sutra carry out religious practice as the sutra directs, then every one of them without exception will surely attain buddhahood within his or her present lifetime. To cite an analogy, if one plants the fields in spring and summer, then, whether it be early or late, one is certain to reap a harvest within the year."

Buddhahood attainment doesn't mean becoming special humans completely different from now, nor being reborn in distant pure lands next lifetime. The Daishonin explains "attain" as "to open or reveal." Attaining buddhahood simply means revealing our innate buddhahood.

As ordinary people, we can reveal this enlightened life state as we are, expressed in Buddhist concepts of "ordinary people's buddhahood attainment" and "attaining buddhahood in present form."

Buddhahood attainment doesn't mean going elsewhere; it means establishing absolute and indestructible happiness in the real world. The Daishonin teaches that "each thing—the cherry, the plum, the peach, the damson—in its own entity, without undergoing any change, possesses the eternally endowed three bodies [of a buddha]."

Attaining buddhahood means living utilizing our unique inherent qualities and developing our potential fully. Our lives become purified, giving full expression to inherent workings; we gain strong inner states unsways by any hardship.

Buddhahood attainment isn't achieving final goals. The buddhahood state features unremitting struggle eliminating evil and generating good based on Mystic Law faith. Those striving tirelessly for kosen-rufu are buddhas.

### Ordinary People's Buddhahood and Present Form Attainment

Buddhist texts frequently use "ordinary person" or "common mortal," indicating unenlightened persons. The Lotus Sutra teaches that ordinary people inherently possess buddhahood's life state and can reveal that state. We can manifest this noble life state as ordinary people, expressed in concepts like "ordinary people are identical with the highest level" and "an ordinary person is a buddha."

Buddhahood attainment is manifesting the originally present Buddha life state in all people (the inherent buddhahood world). Buddhas aren't special beings separate from or superior to humans. The Daishonin taught buddhahood attainment reveals highest humanity—buddhahood—in our ordinary lives.

"Attaining buddhahood in present form" means people realize the Buddha life state just as they are without rebirth and changing their ordinary person form.

Though other Mahayana sutras teach buddhahood attainment, they require at least two conditions. First, one cannot belong to groups deemed incapable: two-vehicle practitioners (voice-hearers and cause-awakened ones), evil people, and women.

Two-vehicle practitioners believed Buddha attainment impossible and sought arhat stage—the highest awakening stage in voice-hearer teachings where all earthly desires extinguished, ending rebirth cycles. Many Mahayana sutras harshly condemned such practitioners as unable to attain buddhahood.

These sutras also taught evil people must first be reborn good and women reborn men before attaining buddhahood. Neither evil people nor women could attain buddhahood as they were. Though these sutras taught buddhahood possibility, only limited people met actual requirements.

The second condition in Mahayana sutras besides the Lotus Sutra was engaging in Buddhist practice over repeated birth-death cycles (countless kalpas of practice) freeing oneself from unenlightened ordinary person status achieving Buddha status.

Conversely, the Lotus Sutra teaches buddhahood attainment isn't becoming exceptional or extraordinary, but each person revealing buddhahood's life state within themselves as they are.

Nichiren Daishonin further clarified that the fundamental Law by which all buddhas attain enlightenment is Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. He manifested his enlightened life state one with that Law in the Gohonzon—Nam-myoho-renge-kyo's devotion object.

By embracing Gohonzon faith in Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, anyone can reveal the buddhahood inherent in their life.

Nichikan wrote: "If we accept and believe in this object of devotion and chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo to it, then our lives are themselves the object of devotion of three thousand realms in a single moment of life; we are the founder, Nichiren Daishonin."

By believing the Gohonzon and continuing Buddhist practice exertion for kosen-rufu's sake, we can manifest in our ordinary lives Nichiren Daishonin's same buddhahood state. This expresses attaining buddhahood in present form and this lifetime principles.

[Note: Nichikan (1665–1726) was an Edo period scholar priest systematizing and emphasizing Nichiren Daishonin's Buddhist principles as inherited through direct disciple and successor Nikko Shonin.]

### Earthly Desires and Enlightenment

Attaining buddhahood in present form perspectives include principles that "earthly desires are enlightenment" and "the sufferings of birth and death are nirvana."

Even ordinary people whose lives dominate earthly desires, burden negative karma, and afflict suffering can awaken to buddhahood existing in their own lives, manifest Buddha's enlightenment wisdom, liberate from suffering, and realize complete freedom.

Lives tormented by earthly desires and suffering can become limitless freedom lives shining enlightened wisdom as they are. This means "earthly desires are enlightenment."

Nichiren Daishonin teaches that our buddhahood world is Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. Believing the Gohonzon, chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, and awakening to true, noble selves brings forth wisdom for living, courage and confidence facing adversity, and others' welfare compassion.

"The sufferings of birth and death are nirvana" means though in painful birth-death-caused suffering states, believing the Gohonzon and chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo manifests the tranquil Buddha enlightenment life state (nirvana) in our lives.

"Earthly desires are enlightenment" and "sufferings of birth and death are nirvana" principles teach us that Mystic Law faith-based living creates positive, proactive lives transforming every problem and suffering into growth and happiness causes.

### Relative and Absolute Happiness

Second Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda (1900–58) taught two happiness kinds: relative and absolute happiness.

Relative happiness describes material needs fulfillment and personal desires satisfaction conditions. But desires lack limits; even temporary desire fulfillment satisfaction doesn't last. Since this happiness depends on external circumstances, circumstance changes or disappearance eliminate happiness. Such happiness is "relative" because it exists only regarding external factors.

Absolute happiness is a life state in which being alive itself is happiness and joy sources regardless of location or circumstances. It describes happiness conditions welling forth from within. Because external conditions don't influence it, it's called absolute happiness. Buddhahood attainment means establishing this absolute happiness state.

Living amid real world realities, various problems and difficulties are inevitable. But like physically strong and fit people easily climbing mountains carrying heavy loads, those establishing absolute happiness inner states use any challenges as powerful life force bringing forth impetuses, calmly overcoming adversity. Strong mountain climbers enjoy greater satisfaction overcoming steeper, more demanding ascents toward summits. Similarly, those acquiring Buddhist practice life force and hardship-overcoming wisdom find the real world with its troubles and challenges rich satisfaction and fulfillment value-creating places.

Additionally, while relative happiness depending on external factors disappears with death, buddhahood's life state absolute happiness persists eternally. The Daishonin says: "Passing through the round of births and deaths, one makes one's way on the land of the Dharma nature, or enlightenment, that is inherent within oneself."

### Establishing the Correct Teaching for Peace and Kosen-rufu

As practice guidelines securing self and others happiness amid social realities, Nichiren Daishonin emphasized establishing correct teaching for land peace and kosen-rufu importance.

**Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land**

Nichiren Daishonin's Buddhism is teaching enabling people transforming life conditions and developing absolute happiness states within this lifetime. Through such profound individual inner transformation, it aims at achieving whole society peace.

The Daishonin sets forth peace realization principles in his "On Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land" treatise.

"Establishing correct teaching" means promoting correct Buddhism teaching faith and acceptance as life foundations and making Buddhist life-dignity-respecting teachings society's fundamental motivating principles. "For the peace of the land" means realizing society peace and prosperity and individual daily life safety and security.

Beyond indicating ruling-authority-centering political institutions, "land" in "On Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land" refers deeper to people's daily lives and sustenance bases. It refers to not only human-formed social structures but also the land itself—the natural environment.

The Daishonin's belief that people are the central land presence may appear in his frequent original manuscript use of "land" characters (also "country" or "nation") written with "people" elements inside rectangular enclosures, rather than characters using "king" elements or suggesting military domain elements, which more commonly appeared.

The Daishonin wrote: "A king sees his people as his parents," asserting rulers should make people their foundation. He further warned that rulers "failing to heed or understand the populace afflictions" will fall into evil paths.

Though written to realize contemporary Japan peace, "On Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land" underlying spirit aims at people peace and security achievement and further actualizing entire world peace and all humanity happiness into distant futures.

The Daishonin wrote this treatise and remonstrated with ruling authorities desiring to end his day's people sufferings. He exemplified that Buddhist practitioners shouldn't content themselves with solely personal enlightenment-praying Buddhist practice. Rather, they must actively engage solving society problems and issues basing themselves on Buddhism principles and spirit.

In his treatise, the Daishonin wrote: "If you care anything about your personal security, you should first of all pray for order and tranquility throughout the four quarters of the land, should you not?"

Mahayana Buddhism sternly repudiates the self-centered attitude exemplified by society problems averting and religious faith alone withdrawing.

Today's Soka Gakkai engages resolving global issues through peace, culture, education, and human rights area activities based on Nichiren Buddhism principles and ideals. These efforts directly accord with the Daishonin-articulated correct teaching establishment for land peace principle and spirit.

**Kosen-rufu**

Buddhism's aim is sharing and spreading correct teaching embodying Buddha's enlightenment and guiding all people toward buddhahood's life state attainment and all humanity peace and prosperity actualization.

Therefore, the Lotus Sutra, Shakyamuni Buddha states: "After I have passed into extinction, in the last five-hundred-year period you must spread it [this teaching] abroad widely throughout Jambudvipa [the entire world] and never allow it to be cut off, nor must you allow [negative forces such as] evil devils, the devils' people, heavenly beings, dragons, yakshas, kumbhanda demons, or others to seize the advantage!"

This passage states that the last five-hundred-year period—this present Latter Day of the Law period—the Mystic Law should spread widely throughout the entire world. "Spread abroad widely" here translates the Chinese characters pronounced kosen-rufu in Japanese.

In the Lotus Sutra, the Buddha entrusts the Latter Day of the Law's widespread propagation, or kosen-rufu, mission to the Bodhisattvas of the Earth—his disciples from unimaginably remote past who thoroughly forged themselves.

During Lotus Sutra preaching, countless such bodhisattvas emerge from the earth. Led by Bodhisattva Superior Practices, they vow propagating the Mystic Law, the Lotus Sutra essence, after Shakyamuni's passing.

Shakyamuni in turn predicts these Bodhisattvas of the Earth appearing in this suffering-filled world after his death, illuminating people's lives' darkness like sun and moon and leading them to enlightenment.

**Kosen-rufu: Nichiren Daishonin's Fundamental Spirit**

In exact accord with the aforementioned Lotus Sutra passage, Nichiren Daishonin strove spreading Nam-myoho-renge-kyo's great Law in the evil Latter Day age while enduring numerous life-threatening persecutions.

The Daishonin touches the Mystic Law's widespread propagation, or kosen-rufu: "The 'great vow' refers to the propagation of the Lotus Sutra [Nam-myoho-renge-kyo]."

"If Nichiren's compassion is truly great and encompassing, Nam-myoho-renge-kyo will spread for ten thousand years and more, for all eternity, for it has the beneficial power to open the blind eyes of every living being in the country of Japan, and it blocks off the road that leads to the hell of incessant suffering."

"When I, Nichiren, first took faith in the Lotus Sutra, I was like a single drop of water or a single particle of dust in all the country of Japan. But later, when two people, three people, ten people, and eventually a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, and a million people come to recite the Lotus Sutra [chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo] and transmit it to others, then they will form a Mount Sumeru of perfect enlightenment, an ocean of great nirvana. Seek no other path by which to attain buddhahood!"

From these passages, achieving kosen-rufu—the Mystic Law's widespread propagation—clearly represents Nichiren Daishonin's fundamental spirit.

The Daishonin repeatedly urged his followers dedicating their lives to kosen-rufu, attaining buddhahood, and actualizing correct teaching establishment for land peace principles.

**The Soka Gakkai: Making Kosen-rufu Reality**

The Soka Gakkai is Buddhist practitioners' harmonious gathering who inherited and continue the Daishonin's spirit, spreading the Mystic Law as he taught in his writings.

The Daishonin wrote: "If you are of the same mind as Nichiren, you must be a Bodhisattva of the Earth." The Soka Gakkai, spreading the Mystic Law in the same Daishonin spirit, is the Bodhisattvas of the Earth organization fulfilling kosen-rufu's mission.

Until seven hundred years after the Daishonin's death, the Soka Gakkai appeared, no one widely spread the Mystic Law. The Soka Gakkai has made Shakyamuni and Nichiren Daishonin's predictions reality. This proves the Soka Gakkai is the organization emerged carrying out kosen-rufu's mission, acting in accord with the Buddha's intent.

The Soka Gakkai makes kosen-rufu reality, spreading the Mystic Law throughout the entire world, just as the Lotus Sutra teaches.
