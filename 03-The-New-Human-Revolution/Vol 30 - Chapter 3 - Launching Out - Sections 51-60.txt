# Volume 30: Chapter 3, Launching Out 51–60

## Launching Out 51

Shin'ichi emphasized the importance of practicing Buddhism through both action and study. He stated that genuine disciples of Nichiren must engage in both, noting that "practice and study arise from faith." He warned against becoming overly focused on Buddhist doctrine while neglecting actual practice, explaining that such imbalance leads practitioners astray. The Soka Gakkai's approach to study remains oriented toward deepening faith and achieving happiness rather than producing professional scholars.

During his Hawaii visit, Shin'ichi paid respects at the USS Arizona Memorial and participated in cultural festivals. He spoke about spreading Nichiren Buddhism to build world peace, emphasizing that "respect for the dignity of life starts with manifesting our inherent Buddhahood." He later traveled to Los Angeles, where a culture festival drew approximately 15,000 attendees celebrating the city's bicentennial with performances by Japanese and American members.

Tomomasa Yamawaki was arrested on charges of extortion and attempted extortion following a police investigation. Yamawaki had waged smear campaigns against the Soka Gakkai through tabloid publications, but these allegations proved baseless during his trial. Shin'ichi interrupted his U.S. activities to return to Japan, where he underwent interviews with the prosecutor's office before resuming his international travels.

## Launching Out 54

Shin'ichi traveled to Mexico for his second formal visit in 16 years. He visited cultural sites, met with government officials including the Mexican president, and donated books to universities. While touring Mexico City, he visited the Angel of Independence Monument, recalling his mentor Josei Toda's vivid dream-like description of the same location. Toda had encouraged him: "You must go out into the world. The world is your true stage."

## Launching Out 55

Shin'ichi reflected on Toda's influence as he stood before the Independence Monument. Though Toda never left Japan, he had studied Mexican geography extensively and encouraged his disciple to travel globally for kosen-rufu. Shin'ichi renewed his commitment to building worldwide Buddhist movements in Toda's honor. He subsequently visited Guadalajara, delivering a lecture on Mexican culture and its importance for peace-building.

## Launching Out 56

Shin'ichi's lecture at the University of Guadalajara highlighted "the unique warmth of the people of Mexico" and their poetic spirit. He praised Mexico's efforts to maintain Latin America as a nuclear-free zone. After returning briefly to Los Angeles and Hawaii, he arrived back in Japan on March 12 to attend Soka Gakkai Day celebrations, then departed again on May 9 for the Soviet Union, Europe, and North America.

## Launching Out 57

Shin'ichi visited the Soviet Union at the invitation of Moscow State University and the Ministry of Higher Education, bringing a delegation of approximately 250 members including musical and performance groups. He met with numerous Soviet officials and cultural leaders, visiting the Moscow Musical Theater for Children and paying respects at significant Soviet monuments. He also visited the gravesite of former Premier Aleksey Kosygin, whom he had previously met to discuss peace initiatives.

## Launching Out 58

Director Lyudmila Gvishiani, daughter of the late Premier Kosygin, met with Shin'ichi at the All-Union State Library of Foreign Literature. She presented him with a crystal vase honoring her father and his final writings, explaining that "these books still retain the warmth of my father's hands." This exchange exemplified how personal friendships could bridge political differences and promote lasting peace.

## Launching Out 59

Shin'ichi visited the grave of former Moscow State University Rector Rem Khokhlov and met with his family, including his widow Elena and sons Aleksei and Dmitry. The conversation touched on scholarly pursuits and personal growth. Shin'ichi encouraged the sons to "become great scholars who surpass even your father and make a positive contribution to society." These deep-rooted friendships demonstrated how personal connections foster peaceful exchange.

## Launching Out 60

Shin'ichi engaged in extensive dialogue with Moscow State University Rector Anatoli Logunov about educational exchange, world peace, and nuclear disarmament. Logunov stated that "nuclear weapons would result in the complete annihilation of the human race," emphasizing that peace must be pursued through wisdom rather than force. Their conversations, totaling 13 meetings over time, produced two published dialogues exploring humanity and peace, demonstrating that "world peace begins with joining people's hearts."
