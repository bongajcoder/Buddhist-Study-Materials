# Volume 30: Chapter 3, Launching Out 1–10

## Launching Out 1

Beijing's spring weather welcomed Shin'ichi Yamamoto and the Fifth Soka Gakkai Delegation to China on April 21, 1980. After stepping down as organization president, Yamamoto aimed to strengthen friendship between China and Japan through grassroots exchange and advance peaceful cooperation into the 21st century.

An airport official noted how weather conditions had dramatically improved for their arrival. Yamamoto reflected on the Soka Gakkai's challenges in Japan, viewing current obstacles as temporary, like dispersing dust storms that eventually clear to reveal blue skies.

An embroidered tapestry in the VIP room depicted the Dragon Gate waterfall—a legendary site where carp transform into dragons upon successful ascent. This metaphor resonated with delegation members contemplating their organization's history of overcoming adversity.

Yamamoto visited an exhibition on Premier Zhou Enlai's life, then met with Deng Yingchao, the premier's widow, at her residence. During their 90-minute conversation, Deng shared how she and Zhou had pledged to scatter his ashes across China rather than build a monument, believing "their ashes would become nutrients for plants and thus be of use to the people."

This revolutionary decision reflected Zhou's lifelong commitment to serving the nation's population above personal legacy.

At Peking University, an academic exchange agreement was signed between the institution and Soka University. Yamamoto received an honorary professorship and delivered a lecture examining how Chinese civilization historically questioned universal principles through particular circumstances, contrasting Western traditions of applying universal concepts to diverse populations.

Yamamoto praised China's approach of observing reality directly to discover underlying principles, noting British historian Arnold Toynbee's observations about Chinese universalism developed through centuries of history.

## Launching Out 4

Sichuan University received a presentation of 1,000 books from Yamamoto, initiating educational and cultural collaboration. He subsequently met with Chang Shuhong, director of the Dunhuang Cultural Relics Research Institute, a 76-year-old scholar dedicated to preserving ancient Buddhist art.

Chang described discovering Dunhuang through photographs while studying painting in Paris during 1927. Though astounded by the art's beauty, he realized "a place of such wonderful art and culture was so little known seemed wrong to him," prompting his 1936 decision to return and dedicate himself to preservation work.

Chang relocated to remote Dunhuang in 1943 to establish a research center. Living conditions were harsh—minimal shelter, no reliable water, extreme winter temperatures, and no medical facilities. Tragically, his younger daughter died from illness during his early years there.

Despite these hardships, Chang embraced the challenge, stating he would "gladly accept a life sentence in this vast expanse of ancient Buddhist culture." His decades-long commitment to planting trees and preventing erosion eventually earned international recognition for the institute's preservation efforts.

## Launching Out 6

In 1990, an exhibition of Chang's paintings opened at Tokyo's Fuji Art Museum. A monumental canvas titled "Chomolungma Peak" (Mount Everest's Tibetan name) depicted the snow-capped summit with climbers ascending toward it.

Chang and his wife, Li Chengxian, created this masterpiece immediately after the Cultural Revolution amid severe material shortages. Chang insisted on presenting it to Yamamoto, explaining: "you have given hope to countless individuals. That's why I think presenting this painting to you is completely appropriate."

Chang and Li created an improved version of the painting using better materials to ensure longevity. Following its April 1992 completion, the work became treasured artwork at the Tokyo Makiguchi Memorial Hall, welcoming international members.

Their ongoing exchange flourished through exhibitions and honors. The Dunhuang Academy presented Yamamoto with honorary research fellow status (1992) and a bronze medal (1994) recognizing his support for cultural preservation efforts.

On April 24, Yamamoto met Premier Hua Guofeng for 90 minutes at the Great Hall of the People. They discussed China's Ten-Year Plan, the Cultural Revolution, bureaucratization, and education for future generations.

Premier Hua acknowledged Yamamoto's previous visits and awareness of the Soka Gakkai's grassroots approach to human development. They discussed challenges feeding over one billion people and establishing agriculture as the economic foundation while improving farmers' livelihoods.

Yamamoto noted that addressing bureaucratism required educating officials, reforming institutions, and promoting public oversight—essential tasks as organizations risk rigidity when leaders prioritize self-interest over service.

Departing Beijing on April 25, the delegation traveled to Guilin via Guangzhou. Near the Li River, they encountered children selling medicines. When Yamamoto humorously asked for medicine to enhance intelligence, one girl replied without hesitation: "We've just run out of it, I'm afraid."

Her witty response delighted everyone. Yamamoto purchased ointments as souvenirs, reflecting that children represent society's precious future and mirrors of tomorrow's promise. He renewed his commitment to promoting educational exchange for younger generations.

## Launching Out 10

During a scenic riverboat journey down the Li River, officials expressed concern about Yamamoto's visits to the Soviet Union, fearing damage to China-Japan relations.

Yamamoto respectfully disagreed, arguing: "the times are changing dramatically...we must steer the world in the direction of peace for all humanity." He explained his belief that great powers should cooperate rather than remain antagonistic, and that Soviet leaders had expressed peaceful intentions toward China.

While unable to convince all officials, Yamamoto remained committed to fostering harmony across nations, believing the world naturally moves toward "the great ocean of peace for all humanity."
