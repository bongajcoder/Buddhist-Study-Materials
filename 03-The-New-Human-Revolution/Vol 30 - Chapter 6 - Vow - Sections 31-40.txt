# Volume 30: Chapter 6, Vow 31–40

## Vow 31

Shin'ichi met with Soviet President Gorbachev, who emphasized that dialogue works best when both parties abandon power dynamics and speak openly about problems. Their 70-minute conversation received worldwide coverage through major Soviet media outlets and Japanese broadcasters.

In April 1991, Gorbachev visited Japan as promised. Shin'ichi praised the Soviet leader's sacrifices in pursuing perestroika, and both expressed hopes for strengthened friendship between their nations.

## Vow 32

Shin'ichi welcomed Nelson Mandela at the Seikyo Shimbun building in Tokyo on October 31, 1990, where approximately 500 youth gathered. Mandela, who spent over 27 years imprisoned for fighting apartheid, later became South Africa's president in 1994.

Shin'ichi expressed profound respect for Mandela's achievements and noted his creation of educational opportunities within prison—what he called a "Mandela University." He emphasized that "anywhere can be a place of learning" for those committed to self-improvement.

## Vow 33

Mandela responded warmly to Shin'ichi, calling their meeting "a source of illumination, strength, and hope." Shin'ichi proposed several initiatives to support the anti-apartheid movement, including welcoming ANC students to Soka University, hosting cultural performances, and organizing exhibitions on human rights and apartheid.

He stressed that changing public awareness proves essential for advancing human rights protections globally.

## Vow 34

Soka University presented Mandela with its Award of Highest Honor. Shin'ichi discussed the Buddhist concept of "human flowers" from the Lotus Sutra, explaining how Buddhism has historically opposed all forms of discrimination based on caste, race, ethnicity, or background.

He presented Mandela with a poem expressing admiration for his "indomitable strength" and calling him a "comrade in spirit."

## Vow 35

When Shin'ichi read Mandela's famous words—"I have fought against White domination...I have cherished the ideal of a democratic...society"—Mandela responded deeply. He stated that wisdom is imperishable, unlike medals or certificates, and promised never to forget their encounter.

Genuine dialogue creates mutual inspiration and illumination between committed leaders.

## Vow 36

As their meeting concluded, Shin'ichi told Mandela that great leaders face persecution but that true justice emerges over centuries. Their hearts resonated as both fought for humanity's welfare.

Following this meeting, Shin'ichi intensified his citizen diplomacy efforts, meeting with numerous African, European, and Asian leaders throughout late 1990 and 1991, including Presidents Kaunda, Gowon, and Aquino.

## Vow 37

Beyond political leaders, Shin'ichi engaged with prominent academics, artists, and educators from every continent during 1990-1991. He met figures including UNESCO Director Federico Mayor and Harvard Professor John Montgomery.

He composed poems for many leaders, including Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's widow, Soviet President Gorbachev, Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, and former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. He wrote for Philippine President Aquino: "The person who truly protects the people will find the people on her side."

## Vow 38

Shin'ichi composed lengthy poems to encourage SGI members worldwide pursuing kosen-rufu. In 1987 alone, he created poems dedicated to members in various countries—from "Arise, the Sun of the Century" for SGI-USA to "A Rainbow over Niagara" for SGI-Canada.

His poems offered practical guidance on faith and character development, emphasizing that "faith is manifested in your daily life" and encouraging members to polish their character to expand the Law's influence.

## Vow 39

In the decade since 1979, Shin'ichi had traveled extensively to create momentum for kosen-rufu and world peace. The world now approached a major turning point—the Cold War's conclusion.

The division between Eastern and Western blocs originated from the 1945 Yalta Conference where Allied leaders carved the postwar world into spheres of influence. This framework led to nuclear tensions, the Berlin Wall's construction in 1961, and the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.

Division perpetuates division, making a unifying philosophy centered on shared humanity essential.

## Vow 40

Shin'ichi remained confident that history would move toward peace and unity. In 1968, he proposed normalizing Japan-China relations and admitting China to the United Nations, believing isolation would harm global peace.

Between 1974 and December, he visited both countries privately, conveying messages between Chinese and Soviet leaders seeking reconciliation. All efforts stemmed from his conviction that resolving superpower conflicts served humanity's wellbeing.

The passage concludes: "Nothing can be achieved by giving up. Peace is a struggle against resignation."
