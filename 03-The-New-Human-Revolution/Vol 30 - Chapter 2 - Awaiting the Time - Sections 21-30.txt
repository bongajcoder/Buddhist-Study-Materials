# Volume 30: Chapter 2, Awaiting the Time 21–30

Shin'ichi encouraged landscape gardener Wataru Yanagisaka and his wife Shizu from Saku City, who maintained the Nagano Training Center grounds. He praised their dedication, noting that "all of your efforts are certain to bring you immeasurable benefits and boundless good fortune."

After completing 30 group photo sessions with over 3,000 members, Shin'ichi thanked the young volunteer staff and commended the prefecture's young men's division leader for organizing logistics despite difficult conditions. He emphasized the importance of remaining with the Soka Gakkai throughout life and dedicating oneself to members and kosen-rufu (spreading Buddhism), encouraging them that "the Buddhas and heavenly deities are aware of all your efforts."

On August 27, Shin'ichi visited the Komoro Culture Center, participating in group photo sessions with approximately 300 members. He stressed the importance of prioritizing daimoku (chanting) and practicing with courageous faith.

During his final day in Nagano on August 28, he spoke with Nagano Prefecture Leader Takashi Saida about the training center's potential. He urged the prefecture to become "the world's foremost model of human harmony" and emphasized that unity requires prefecture leaders to demonstrate genuine concern for members' welfare. He stressed that people respond to earnest, sincere leadership rather than lazy or irresponsible guidance.

Shin'ichi returned to Tokyo on August 28 after nine days of intensive member encouragement in Nagano. Though his efforts received minimal coverage in the Seikyo Shimbun, his subsequent annual visits sparked expanding training courses that became a new Soka Gakkai tradition.

The training center eventually hosted regional, divisional, and national executive conferences, attracting international scholars and thinkers including writer Chinghiz Aitmatov, philosophers from Delaware University, John Dewey Society leaders, and officials from institutions in India and China.

On August 6, 1993, Shin'ichi began writing his serialized novel *The New Human Revolution* at the Nagano Training Center. Members regarded their shared struggles with Shin'ichi as their greatest pride, developing an "invincible fighting spirit" grounded in mentor-disciple unity.

On September 15 (Respect for the Aged Day), Shin'ichi completed his 30th home visit since May, visiting pioneer members in Komae City. He had prayed earnestly during the 1974 Typhoon Polly disaster that swept away homes in the area.

Observing the developing suburban landscape, he told accompanying members that "Tokyo No. 2 Area is a fresh stage for kosen-rufu. It has a bright future." He highlighted the importance of self-motivated, proactive faith and the joy found in setting personal goals and working self-reliantly to achieve them.

He quoted author Saneatsu Mushanokoji: "Another step forward...Now is the crucial moment." Such accumulated steps transform lives, communities, and society.

As founder of Soka University, Soka Junior and Senior High Schools, and Tokyo Soka Elementary School, Shin'ichi prioritized education as his life's crowning endeavor. In September 1979, he participated in Asian pear-picking with university and high school students and took photos with correspondence course participants.

He drew from personal experience, having graduated from Toyo Commercial High School's night course and attended Taisei Gakuin's night college starting in 1948. After the publishing company where he worked collapsed in 1949, he discontinued formal studies but received intensive private instruction from his mentor Josei Toda—what he called "Toda University."

Years later, Shin'ichi completed 10 graduating papers, including one on Japanese industrial capital. This experience deepened his empathy for correspondence students facing study challenges while working, reinforcing his determination to support their perseverance.

During September campus visits, Shin'ichi joined rugby, baseball, and table tennis teams for photographs. Speaking at the October athletic meet closing ceremony, he urged students to master fundamentals during university to address future societal challenges.

He attended elementary school events like athletic meets and potato-digging days, visited dormitory students, encouraging them to become "shining presences" who warmly supported others and imparted hope and courage.

At the November 2 Soka University Festival and November 3 Soyu-kai alumni meeting, he engaged with graduates pursuing self-development. One alumnus declared: "The time for simply declaring determinations is past...It is time for us to report our results...That is what it means to stand up as disciples."

Shin'ichi responded approvingly, urging them to "pave the way forward with the spirit that you are all the founders."

## Awaiting the Time 27

On November 16, a Soka Gakkai Headquarters leaders meeting commemorating the organization's 49th founding anniversary was held at the Toda Memorial Auditorium in Sugamo, Toshima Ward—location of the Tokyo Detention Center where founders Makiguchi and Toda were imprisoned, with Makiguchi dying for his beliefs.

The auditorium, completed in June 1979, stood as a lasting monument to their dedication. Shin'ichi determined to create "a victorious groundswell for kosen-rufu" from this historically significant location.

He reflected on Nichiren Daishonin's teaching: "When great evil occurs, great good follows." Makiguchi's sacrifice opened the way for kosen-rufu's triumphant development, though transformation requires "firmly determined" commitment and "courageous action."

## Awaiting the Time 28

Halfway through the November 16 meeting, Shin'ichi entered the stage to enthusiastic applause. Instead of speaking, he removed his jacket and led members in the "Song of Indomitable Dignity"—his first time leading members in song since stepping down as president.

He demonstrated that "no matter what limits are put on our actions, if we maintain an unshakable commitment to kosen-rufu, nothing will block our way forward."

As he led the rousing melody, audience members clapped vigorously, sang with emotion, and blazed with fighting spirit. Their unified participation created new momentum for victory from Tokyo that day, embodying the principle that "Buddhism is about winning" and that champions of kosen-rufu are champions of life and happiness.

## Awaiting the Time 29

Shin'ichi continued meeting divisional and regional representatives at the Kanagawa Training Center and Shinjuku Culture Center despite tabloid attacks on the Soka Gakkai. He found inspiration in witnessing encouraged members overcome obstacles and achieve victory.

While conversing with young men's division and student division leaders at Yokohama's Kanagawa Culture Center, one young leader expressed sadness that Shin'ichi no longer gave guidance at meetings. Shin'ichi responded sharply: "If that's how the youth feel, then you must all take action...Youth must resolve to take full responsibility and be the driving force for development."

When the leader mentioned senior opposition to youth proposals, Shin'ichi acknowledged that generational tension occurs in all organizations. Older people bring valuable experience but may resist unfamiliar ideas; when circumstances change dramatically, experience-based approaches become inadequate.

Shin'ichi advised youth division leaders to develop persuasion skills by explaining proposals clearly, logically, citing data and examples. He referenced Nichiren Daishonin: "Buddhism is reason. Reason will win over your lord."

He emphasized the importance of passionate youth appeals, establishing successful track records, and persistence despite rejection. He illustrated from his 1954 appointment as youth division chief of staff: the board initially doubted his proposals, including the athletic meet concept that later became a Soka Gakkai hallmark.

"But after several such events were held and widely applauded, they went on to become a hallmark of the Soka Gakkai. It was a victory of the power of youth."
