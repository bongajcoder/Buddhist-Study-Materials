# Volume 30: Chapter 6, Vow 11–20

## Vow 11
Shin'ichi Yamamoto addressed the Kansai Youth Peace Culture Festival, expressing the Soka Gakkai's commitment to peace based on Nichiren Buddhism. He encouraged youth to overcome slander and criticism, stating they should become trustworthy in their communities. The festival concluded with celebration, though tensions soon emerged when High Priest Nikken Abe summoned Shin'ichi, objecting to language about "elevating" the Daishonin's Buddhism as disrespectful.

Nikken further criticized Shin'ichi's choice of titles in his remarks. Despite this confrontation, Shin'ichi remained committed to maintaining priesthood-laity harmony. The First Chubu Youth Peace Culture Festival followed on April 29, drawing 70,000 youth. Despite rain forecasts, clear skies emerged, and UN officials praised the event's demonstration that "peace isn't something created in some distant part of the world, but something we must work to build" locally.

As final speaker, Shin'ichi emphasized the importance of having "a solid philosophy" and returning to basic questions about life's purpose and peace. He encouraged participants to "be reliable and trustworthy people in your workplaces, schools, homes, and communities." The festival represented the fulfillment of a shared vow between Shin'ichi and his mentor Josei Toda to establish Chubu as a fortress for kosen-rufu.

## Vow 14
The Second World Peace Culture Festival occurred September 18-19, 1982, at Seibu Lions Stadium with 40,000 youth participants, including 3,000 from international locations. Shin'ichi walked the rain-misted field without an umbrella to thank performers, expressing parental concern for the youth's wellbeing above all else.

## Vow 15
Performances included "Sparkling Eyes," group gymnastics titled "Soaring Flight," and a card art display spelling "Waves of Peace." The young women's division performed the "Dance of Torches" with 600 lights. UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar sent a message emphasizing that NGOs "have an extremely important role to play in helping generate public support for the United Nations."

## Vow 16
Throughout 1982, the Soka Gakkai launched numerous peace initiatives including youth lectures, exhibitions on war experiences, refugee assistance campaigns, and exhibitions about the United Nations. A 50-person delegation traveled to New York for the UN's special disarmament session, including atomic bomb survivors who shared their experiences. The "Nuclear Threat to Our World" exhibition was displayed at UN headquarters.

## Vow 17
The nuclear exhibition contained three sections: destruction in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, factual nuclear information, and disarmament/development. It drew over 200,000 viewers including UN officials and diplomats. The exhibition subsequently traveled internationally, eventually being shown in 25 cities across 16 countries by 1988, viewed by over 1.2 million people.

## Vow 18
Following guidance from Josei Toda about making concrete peace proposals, Shin'ichi issued his "Proposal for Disarmament and the Abolition of Nuclear Arms" during the 1982 UN special session on disarmament. He proposed that NGOs help facilitate disarmament and called for non-nuclear states to secure commitments against preemptive strikes. Beginning in 1983, he issued annual peace proposals on SGI Day.

## Vow 19
In May 1983, the SGI obtained NGO consultative status with the UN Economic and Social Council. That August, Shin'ichi received the United Nations Peace Award from UN Under-Secretary-General Yasushi Akashi. Secretary-General Pérez de Cuéllar cited his efforts promoting "understanding and friendship among nations" and making "constructive proposals for the relaxation of international tension." Later, Shin'ichi received the UNHCR Humanitarian Award in 1989.

## Vow 20
The Soka Gakkai's peace activism traces to founding president Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, who resisted militarist pressure to enshrine Shinto talismans, resulting in his 1943 arrest and death in prison in 1944. His disciple Josei Toda issued a 1957 declaration calling nuclear weapons an "absolute evil." Nichiren Buddhism's emphasis on human value over state authority provided the spiritual foundation for these principled stands on human rights and peace.
