# Volume 30: Chapter 2, Awaiting the Time 41–50

## Summary

This passage from *The New Human Revolution* covers late 1979 through January 1980, focusing on Shin'ichi Yamamoto's leadership during a period of restricted activities following his resignation as Soka Gakkai president.

### Key Events

**The Fife and Drum Corps General Meeting (Awaiting the Time 41-42)**
Shin'ichi addressed performers, emphasizing that "any beautiful accomplishment is backed by arduous effort." He encouraged young members to view coming challenges as opportunities for growth toward the 21st century.

**New Year 1980 (Awaiting the Time 43-44)**
Shin'ichi published poems in the *Seikyo Shimbun* expressing determination to advance kosen-rufu. Members wrote encouraging letters despite ongoing persecution from Nichiren Shoshu priests. The new decade began amid global turmoil—Iran's Islamic revolution, Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and Middle East tensions.

**The Shikoku Ferry Visit (Awaiting the Time 45-50)**
Members from Shikoku creatively circumvented restrictions by chartering a ferry to visit Shin'ichi at the Kanagawa Culture Center on January 14, 1980. Rather than waiting for him to travel, approximately 800 members made the journey by sea, demonstrating what Shin'ichi called "wisdom and resourcefulness" in overcoming obstacles.

The visit included tours of the Toda Peace Memorial Hall, reinforcing the organization's commitment to peace activism and human rights.
