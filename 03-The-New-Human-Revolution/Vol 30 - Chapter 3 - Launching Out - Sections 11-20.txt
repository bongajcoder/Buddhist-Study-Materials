# Volume 30: Chapter 3, Launching Out 11–20

## Launching Out 11

During April 1996, Shin'ichi Yamamoto visited Guilin, China, where he met with Li Luogong, president of the Guilin Art Academy. Their discussion about calligraphy left a lasting impression on Shin'ichi, particularly Li's observation that calligraphy expresses "one's view of the world and the universe, as well as one's character."

Yamamoto then traveled to Shanghai, the final stop of the delegation's China visit. He visited a correctional school for troubled youth, emphasizing to students that "as long as you keep challenging yourself, there is hope." He urged them not to surrender to despair, stating that personal perseverance leads to broader victories.

In Shanghai, Yamamoto met with Fudan University President Su Buqing, a renowned mathematician and long-time acquaintance. During their conversation about education, Su shared his philosophy: learning requires advancing methodically through stages, never skipping steps. He emphasized that persistent effort through moments of apparent impossibility ultimately leads to breakthroughs.

The two men maintained their friendship through subsequent meetings and correspondence over many years.

Yamamoto also met with Ba Jin, a prominent Chinese writer and vice-chair of the China Writers Association. This was their second encounter, following an earlier meeting in Japan where they had discussed literature and society. Ba Jin had previously declared his commitment to writing against oppressive forces and outdated systems.

The conversation between Yamamoto and Ba Jin explored the relationship between literature and politics. Ba Jin asserted that "literature cannot be separated from politics. But politics can never replace literature." He discussed his experience during China's Cultural Revolution, when he was condemned, and his determination to write about those experiences.

Yamamoto and Ba Jin developed a lasting friendship. The China Writers Association later honored Yamamoto with an International Literary Award for Understanding and Friendship in 2003. Ba Jin passed away in 2005 at age 100, and fellow writer Bing Xin died in 1999 at age 98.

On April 29, Yamamoto departed Shanghai for Japan. Before leaving, he wrote a poem in the hotel guest book referencing Nichiren's teachings about Buddhism's eastward transmission and its eventual return westward.

Yamamoto visited the Nagasaki Culture Center, where a leaders meeting commemorated the 22nd anniversary of Nagasaki Chapter's establishment. He spoke about developing Buddhahood within oneself and dedicating efforts to kosen-rufu (widespread Buddhist practice). He noted that while the Soka Gakkai had achieved significant membership milestones, the global movement remained "still in its infancy."
