# Volume 30: Chapter 1, Great Mountain 11–20

## Great Mountain 11

Nichiren Daishonin taught that all people possess Buddha nature equally and can attain enlightenment through the Mystic Law, establishing a life of absolute happiness. This universal teaching emphasizes human equality and respect for life's dignity.

Shin'ichi sensed dangerous deception behind the priests' domineering behavior toward lay believers. During World War II, when Japan's militarist government enforced thought control, Nichiren Shoshu accepted Shinto talismans. However, the Soka Gakkai's first two presidents—Tsunesaburo Makiguchi and Josei Toda—upheld correct teachings and were imprisoned. Makiguchi died in prison for his beliefs, yet the priesthood subsequently harassed the Soka Gakkai despite the organization's postwar support.

According to Buddhist teaching, "neither non-Buddhists nor the enemies of Buddhism can destroy the correct teaching of the Thus Come One, but the Buddha's disciples definitely can." The Lotus Sutra describes how devil forces possess priests who then create confusion among believers. Shin'ichi recalled his mentor's warning: "Kosen-rufu will never advance without the Soka Gakkai."

Shin'ichi prioritized stopping the priests' attacks and protecting members. He had witnessed suffering members across the country subjected to abusive priest behavior. Vice President Genji Samejima's irresponsible statements had nullified all the Soka Gakkai's efforts toward reconciliation.

Determined to protect his members, Shin'ichi considered the Soka Gakkai more precious than anything else—a principle Toda had emphasized throughout his leadership. The organization had become Japan's "king of the religious world" and a force for peace, with members emerging as outstanding individuals across society. Through Buddhist study emphasizing practical daily relevance, members established Nichiren Buddhism as their guiding philosophy.

Entering 1979—when the Seven Bells would conclude—the Soka Gakkai enjoyed unprecedented development and global expansion.

Shin'ichi had long considered stepping down as president to develop successors and ensure the eternal transmission of the Mystic Law. In 1970, after leading for over a decade, he informed executives of his intention to step down, but they insisted the presidency was a lifelong appointment.

In 1974, he relinquished his representative director position to the general director. In 1977, he again raised the presidency succession issue, but executives opposed him.

Now, approaching the 19th anniversary of his inauguration, Shin'ichi reconsidered passing the presidency when appropriate. At 51 and in good health, he could support members afterward. However, significant work remained for world peace and kosen-rufu development globally.

Though the Soka Gakkai enjoyed unprecedented growth, dark clouds loomed with stormy winds blowing. Challenging trials would be inevitable. Leaders succeeding him would need clear faith to recognize devilish forces and determine to overcome them.

On April 3, Shin'ichi addressed Seikyo Shimbun distributors, emphasizing health care for their important mission. He stressed that neglecting basics in faith and daily life indicates carelessness and arrogance. Those desiring fame and fortune while avoiding genuine effort ultimately stumble, unable to escape the Buddhist law of cause and effect.

He encouraged sincere, serious attention to each challenge, noting that though distribution work is hard and often unrecognized, the Seikyo Shimbun's availability and kosen-rufu's advancement depend on their efforts. Shin'ichi assured them: "I am chanting for your well-being and safety every day."

On April 4 evening, attorney Tomomasa Yamawaki, serving as priesthood liaison, called youth division leader Isamu Nomura with urgent news. Meeting with Nomura and General Director Kiyoshi Jujo, Yamawaki warned that Vice President Samejima's statements had provoked the priesthood to plan an all-out attack.

Yamawaki stated: "President Yamamoto will most likely have to resign, not only as the head of all Nichiren Shoshu lay organizations but also as Soka Gakkai president." The words "prepared for the worst" pierced Jujo's heart.

On April 5 morning, Shin'ichi attended an emergency executive conference at the Tachikawa Culture Center. Shin'ichi recognized this as a devilish plot to force his resignation and drive wedges between him and members. He understood the crucial importance of seeing through devilish functions with faith's eyes.

Shin'ichi looked intently at the leaders' troubled expressions. When prompted for opinions, one finally murmured that "you can't go against the flow of the times."

A sharp pain struck Shin'ichi's heart—this cowardice distressed him deeply. While prepared to bow apologetically to the priesthood if necessary, he found it pitiful that leaders now viewed circumstances as "the flow of the times."

Breaking the silence sternly, Shin'ichi declared: "All right, I will resign as the head of all Nichiren Shoshu lay organizations and as Soka Gakkai president." However, he emphasized the critical point: "But it must be the Soka Gakkai, not the priesthood, that decides when its president steps down."

He believed that allowing priesthood pressure to force a president's resignation would create a dangerous precedent and eternally blemish the priesthood's history. The Soka Gakkai, through sincere support, had saved the priesthood from postwar ruin and alone was advancing kosen-rufu with selfless dedication, spreading the Mystic Law worldwide.

Josei Toda had instructed disciples to protect the third president throughout their lives, ensuring kosen-rufu's achievement. Shin'ichi was shocked that leaders had forgotten this spirit their mentor taught for kosen-rufu's sake.

Addressing the leaders with a prayer in his heart, Shin'ichi declared: "I am a lion! I'm not afraid of anything. You need to be lions, too! Otherwise, the members will suffer." He urged them to walk the great path of mentor and disciple with dauntless courage and strong fighting spirit, assuring them that with such commitment, nothing could shake the Soka Gakkai. "President Toda is watching!" he concluded.

Standing and leaving, Shin'ichi gazed at cherry blossoms dancing in the breeze, reflecting on the momentous struggles waged by Makiguchi and Toda as mentor and disciple.

Shin'ichi recalled the April 1952 incident during the head temple's 700th anniversary festivities. Youth division members discovered Jiko Kasahara, supposedly expelled by the priesthood, at the head temple. During World War II, Kasahara had opportunistically espoused the erroneous doctrine that Buddhism is subordinate to Shinto, betraying the Daishonin's teachings and triggering government oppression that led to Makiguchi's imprisonment death.

Youth members pressed Kasahara at Makiguchi's grave to admit his doctrine's error. The priesthood reacted by convening the Nichiren Shoshu Council, which called Toda's actions "a disgraceful incident unprecedented since the head temple's founding" and demanded his apology, dismissal, and temple banishment.

Shin'ichi and other Toda disciples rose to defend him, meeting council members individually to explain events and request resolution revocation. Inside, Shin'ichi burned with outrage, thinking that the priesthood sought to drive a wedge between Toda and members by isolating the president.

Hearing sincere explanations from Shin'ichi and Toda's other disciples, many council members changed their minds and agreed with revoking the disciplinary resolution. High Priest Nissho Mizutani did not act on it.

Overcoming the Kasahara Incident strengthened mentor-disciple unity in the Soka Gakkai, propelling it forward toward Toda's goal of 750,000 member households.

Returning to present circumstances, Shin'ichi was deeply concerned that top leaders lacked the resolute mentor-disciple spirit and passionate fighting spirit for kosen-rufu that had characterized Toda's era.

On April 6, Shin'ichi went to the head temple for the annual Scroll-Airing Ceremony, where he informed High Priest Nittatsu of his intention to resign as both head of Nichiren Shoshu lay organizations and Soka Gakkai president.

Shin'ichi's priority was protecting members from self-serving priests. Even stepping down, he felt confident that younger members would carry the torch toward the 21st century.

On April 7 afternoon, Shin'ichi welcomed a 20-member All-China Youth Federation delegation near the Zhou Cherry Tree on the Soka University campus in Hachioji, Tokyo.

Shin'ichi explained the tree's origins to delegation leader Gao Zhanxiang: "This cherry tree was planted on November 2, 1975, with prayers for Premier Zhou Enlai's health and wishes for lasting peace between our countries." Chinese students studying at Soka University performed the actual planting.

Shin'ichi recounted meeting Premier Zhou in December 1974 at a Beijing hospital. Despite his illness, Zhou expressed earnest wishes for friendly China-Japan relations and world peace, nostalgically reflecting that he had departed Japan during cherry blossom season. When Shin'ichi urged him to return and see the blossoms again, Zhou sadly replied it would probably be impossible.

After Zhou's January 1976 death, Shin'ichi vowed to devote himself entirely to the friendship Zhou cherished and ensure it endured forever. Shin'ichi prepared to plant two additional cherry trees honoring both Premier Zhou and his wife, Deng Yingchao, as a shared vow for everlasting friendship.
