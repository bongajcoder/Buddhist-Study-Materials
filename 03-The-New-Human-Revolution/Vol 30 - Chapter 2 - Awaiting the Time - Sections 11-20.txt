# Volume 30: Chapter 2, Awaiting the Time 11–20

## Awaiting the Time 11

Shin'ichi met with Torao and Tami Tamori, the first chapter and women's division leaders of Karuizawa Chapter. Torao was a skilled baker whose bakery faced declining customers due to community prejudice against the Soka Gakkai. A senior member encouraged them by citing Nichiren Daishonin's teaching that obstacles arise when propagating correct doctrine.

Members responded to such challenges by deepening their faith and studying the Daishonin's writings. Torao reflected that hardship strengthens practitioners' resolve. This integration of Buddhist practice with daily life became the source of the Soka Gakkai's resilience, made possible by second president Josei Toda's publication of the Nichiren Daishonin's collected works.

Torao persevered in his practice and eventually secured contracts supplying bread to schools and Western bakeries. His business flourished, demonstrating the benefits of Buddhist practice while contributing to community development. This success dispelled misconceptions about the Soka Gakkai.

Shin'ichi invited local members to gather at the Tamoris' coffee shop, where he shared Toda's vision of establishing a training center in Karuizawa. He emphasized that the Nagano Training Center would become a global resource for kosen-rufu (Buddhist propagation). That evening, at a joint leaders meeting, Shin'ichi played piano pieces to encourage the members, reinforcing their mentor-disciple bonds.

Shin'ichi's aim was simply for members to maintain strong faith and achieve happiness. Behind the scenes, certain leaders and Nichiren Shoshu priests were attempting to break mentor-disciple bonds by restricting his public appearances and preventing coverage in the Seikyo Shimbun.

Rather than surrendering, Shin'ichi adapted his guidance through home visits, poetry, and music. He proposed that members gather on August 26 for group photographs at the training center. Youth division members enthusiastically prepared, organizing parking, coordinating arrival times, and even clearing a vacant lot for additional space.

On August 24, the 32nd anniversary of joining the Soka Gakkai, Shin'ichi spent the day at the training center in earnest prayer and practice. He rode a bicycle through the area recalling Toda's memories from his final summer there.

When young educators arrived by bus, Shin'ichi greeted them warmly and took a group photograph. He encouraged them to remain steadfast, declaring: "Whatever might happen, never give up your faith." On August 25, he played tennis with Education Department members and participated in their training sessions, demonstrating his commitment despite restrictions on his activities.

## Awaiting the Time 15

On August 25, heavy rain fell as young men's division members worked in the mud to clear the parking lot. Shin'ichi, concerned for their health, arranged for them to use the training center's bath afterward. He then visited Katsuo Ishizuka's home in Saku City to thank the family for providing a private meeting space for Soka Gakkai activities.

Learning it was Ishizuka's father's 80th birthday, Shin'ichi presented a handwritten poem expressing joy at the elder's longevity and wisdom.

Shin'ichi advised Ishizuka on maintaining good neighbor relations regarding the private meeting space—addressing practical concerns like parking and noise while keeping communication open. He emphasized that such member-provided facilities serve as "castles of the people" dedicated to kosen-rufu.

After examining the upstairs community center in Ishizuka's building, Shin'ichi composed poems for the Saku members. He then visited the 350-year-old Kurabayashi family home, fulfilling a six-year-old promise to see their ancestral house.

## Awaiting the Time 17

The Kurabayashi family, whose ancestors had served as district officials since the early Edo period, warmly welcomed Shin'ichi. Tatsuomi Kurabayashi was 71 with five children, all active Soka Gakkai members.

Kurabayashi shared a family legend about an ancestor who rescued a fox from an icy pond; the fox later left pheasants as tokens of gratitude. Shin'ichi connected this to the importance of repaying kindness, contrasting it with the ingratitude he was currently experiencing from certain individuals and priests attacking the Soka Gakkai.

## Awaiting the Time 18

Ten grandchildren of Tatsuomi and Yoshino Kurabayashi performed music for Shin'ichi on various traditional and modern instruments. Seeing these young people inherit their family's faith gave Shin'ichi joy, as kosen-rufu develops through generations in local communities.

Walking in the garden as rain cleared, Shin'ichi told Kurabayashi: "Your life has been a great victory" with successful children and grandchildren. Yet he encouraged continued striving, saying "the most important time is from now on." He presented a poem celebrating the Kurabayashi home as a "silver castle."

## Awaiting the Time 19

On August 26, members streamed to the training center from across Nagano Prefecture for group photographs. It had been nearly four months since Shin'ichi's activities appeared regularly in the Seikyo Shimbun, and members were eager to see him and renew their commitment.

When an elderly woman approached in tears, grateful to see him well, Shin'ichi warmly reassured her: "I will keep the memory of you forever in my heart and chant daimoku for you every day." To an 80-year-old woman, he urged: "Please live to be 100...and see the future of kosen-rufu!"

## Awaiting the Time 20

Endless lines of members waited for group photographs across three bleacher stands. Members arrived from towns throughout the prefecture. As sessions concluded, a young men's division member passionately thanked Shin'ichi and pledged determination.

Shin'ichi responded with an impassioned address: "When the mentor cannot take action out in front, it's the job of the disciples to stand up." He declared members should declare, "Leave it to us!" and brighten others' hearts on his behalf. He asserted "each of you is Shin'ichi Yamamoto" and criticized weakness at crucial moments. Young people's eyes "sparkled with burning determination" as they resolved to shoulder responsibility for kosen-rufu in their communities.
