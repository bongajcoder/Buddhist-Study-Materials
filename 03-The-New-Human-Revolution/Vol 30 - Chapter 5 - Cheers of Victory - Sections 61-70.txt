At the Meguro gathering, Shin'ichi addresses the suffering members have endured from anti-Soka Gakkai priests motivated by envy. He stresses that "action is key" and that resolute leadership can overcome obstacles.

Shin'ichi defines correct faith as "unwavering belief in the Gohonzon throughout one's life, regardless of circumstances." He encourages members to engage in Buddhist dialogue with courage. That year, Meguro members would achieve the nation's top recruitment results with 1,115 new households.
