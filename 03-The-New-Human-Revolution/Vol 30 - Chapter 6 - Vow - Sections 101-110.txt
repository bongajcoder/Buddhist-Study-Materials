# Volume 30: Chapter 6, Vow 101–110

## Vow 101
On February 18, 1993, Buenos Aires hosted the 11th World Youth Peace Culture Festival at the Coliseo Theater with 1,500 youth participants. The event, themed "Melody of Hope in the Land of Ethnic Harmony," attracted prominent Argentine leaders including former president Arturo Frondizi and university presidents. Representatives from ten Central and South American nations attended.

The festival featured performances including flag parades, musical ensembles, and dance performances. The highlight was a joint performance by legendary tango masters Osvaldo Pugliese and Mariano Mores—particularly significant because Pugliese had reportedly retired from public performance in 1989.

Mariano Mores had offered to perform as a birthday gift, declining his own celebration to participate. He and Shin'ichi Yamamoto had first met in 1988 during a Min-On Concert Association tour. Mores later presented Yamamoto with a musical composition titled "Ahora" (Now).

Osvaldo Pugliese arrived via his farewell tour in 1989 and composed "Tokio Luminoso" (Shining Tokyo) for Yamamoto, adding the subtitle "Ode to Friendship." Both artists demonstrated personal commitment to the event and the SGI's peace mission.

The festival succeeded brilliantly, moving Yamamoto to compose commemorative poetry. The following day, February 19, the first SGI-Argentina General Meeting convened with 2,500 members plus attendees from three other Latin American countries and Spain.

Yamamoto received an honorary doctorate from Argentina's National University of Córdoba. Rector Francisco Delich noted that Yamamoto had demonstrated that "countries of Asia and the West" could achieve harmony and that "the human race can overcome conflict" arising from cultural differences.

On February 20, Yamamoto traveled to Paraguay, his first visit to that nation. The mayor of Asunción welcomed him at the airport with an official plaque.

At the first SGI-Paraguay General Meeting on February 21, attended by 700 members, Yamamoto encouraged the children present and acknowledged the pioneering efforts of Japanese immigrants who had faced severe hardships establishing the movement there. The Paraguayan government recognized the visit with special postal markings acknowledging the SGI's UN-registered NGO status and peace advocacy.

Yamamoto emphasized that "one person standing up earnestly" could bring happiness to those around them and transform their environment. He stressed that numerical strength matters less than sincere commitment to practice.

Advising members about children's religious education, he noted that faith must ultimately be chosen freely by young people, while parents should exemplify the benefits through their own practice. The Friendship Evening featured traditional performances including the bottle dance and a specially composed classical guitar piece titled "Fantasía Japonesa."

Yamamoto had planned to visit Brazil in 1974 but was denied a visa due to prejudice against the Soka Gakkai. When he finally visited in 1984, SGI-Paraguay members who had traveled there sang traditional songs expressing their determination to open new pathways for the movement.

Ten years later, at the Paraguay gathering, Yamamoto encouraged youth to "surpass" him and carry forward the pioneering legacy, promising that their efforts would transform kosen-rufu into "a mightily flowing river."

After meeting President Andrés Rodríguez on February 22, Yamamoto attended a National Order of Merit ceremony at Paraguay's Foreign Ministry. The foreign minister praised his peace efforts, noting that dialogue could "eliminate discrimination and realize lasting peace."

Later that day, Yamamoto received an honorary doctorate from the National University of Asunción's Faculty of Philosophy. Before departing for Chile on February 23, he gifted the members a poem referencing Paraguay's rivers and landscape as reflecting "a Buddha land."

Chile would be the 50th country Yamamoto had visited. His global journeys had begun in October 1960, five months after becoming the third Soka Gakkai president in May 1960.

Josei Toda, his mentor, had urged him with his final strength: "The world is your true stage. You must live as long as you can, and travel the globe!" Though Toda never traveled outside Japan, he dreamed of Mexico and instilled in Yamamoto the vision of worldwide kosen-rufu.

Chile's SGI members had endured severe trials. During the 1973 military coup in Santiago, machine-gun fire riddled the leadership couple's home, though they remained safe where the Gohonzon was enshrined.

For years afterward, assemblies were banned; members held informal discussions at homes while authorities observed their meetings. Members drew strength from knowing Yamamoto was aware of their struggles and sent encouragement. Democracy only returned to Chile three years before his visit, allowing free assembly.

## Vow 110
At the first SGI-Chile General Meeting, Yamamoto praised members for remaining "undefeated by adversity" and assured them of accumulating "benefit as boundless as the vast expanse of the Andes."

Reflecting on his 33-year journey that began gazing at Mount Fuji, Yamamoto noted that Chile's Mount Osorno represented the opposite side of the earth. He cited the Daishonin's teaching emphasizing the importance of wisdom and prudent conduct, stressing that Nichiren Buddhism is "a tolerant, engaged religion" requiring cordial relations and mutual respect both within and beyond the organization.
