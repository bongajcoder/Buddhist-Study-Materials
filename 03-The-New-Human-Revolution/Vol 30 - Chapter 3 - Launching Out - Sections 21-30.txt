# Volume 30: Chapter 3, Launching Out 21–30

## Launching Out 21

Shin'ichi Yamamoto arrives at the Kyushu Culture Center in Fukuoka on April 30, where members eagerly greet him. A woman shares her success opening a restaurant featured in a magazine, inviting him to visit.

The following day, May 1, large crowds of members gather. When a young men's division leader tries to manage the flow of visitors, Shin'ichi firmly states: "No one has the right to stop those who have come here to meet me from doing so."

He spends the day meeting members and visiting the woman's restaurant, determined to encourage as many people as possible during this important counteroffensive period.

## Launching Out 22

On May 1 afternoon, Shin'ichi visits the Soka Gakkai Kyushu Memorial Hall, then addresses Fukuoka Prefecture headquarters leaders. He calls out powerfully: "Never lower the banner of kosen-rufu in your hearts!"

Representatives from Oita Prefecture attend, a region suffering from priesthood conflicts. Members tearfully request Shin'ichi visit their prefecture.

By May 2 when Shin'ichi departs, he has encouraged more than 20,000 members across various Kyushu venues.

## Launching Out 23

Takeo Yamaoka, Oita's prefecture secretary, reports to Shin'ichi about a Nichiren Shoshu chief priest attempting to persuade Soka Gakkai members to quit. Yamaoka had spent the night confronting the priest before traveling to Fukuoka.

Shin'ichi responds warmly, sharing his own experiences with priesthood discussions. He expresses determination: "We must protect the precious children of the Buddha" and asks Yamaoka to safeguard the members as his representative.

After encouraging the members, Shin'ichi flies to Kansai on May 3, 1980—the first official Soka Gakkai Day.

## Launching Out 24

At the newly opened Kansai Culture Center in Osaka, crowds of members arrive throughout May 3. Despite space limitations, Shin'ichi directs staff to open the gates, saying members outside are "the most important of all."

He takes numerous photographs with members and event staff, instructing staff to record names for later copies.

## Launching Out 25

Shin'ichi climbs emergency stairs to reach the Ever-Victorious Hall in the annex building where hundreds of members have gathered. Upon entering, he greets them warmly and speaks about bonds forged through faith.

He emphasizes: "While struggling each day with all sorts of personal problems and hardships, you are devoting yourselves with a bright, positive spirit to sharing Buddhism with others."

After addressing the hall, he returns outside to photograph additional members who have gathered.

## Launching Out 26

At the main commemorative gongyo meeting, Shin'ichi addresses the significance of May 3 as Soka Gakkai Day. He discusses the Mystic Law's eternity and the importance of overcoming the "eight winds"—obstacles that cause people to lose faith.

He calls Kansai to become "a model for Japan and the world" and pledges to continue writing history with members' support. The assembly concludes with members singing the Kansai song.

## Launching Out 27

Following the main meeting, Shin'ichi encourages members in other rooms and attends a 5:00 p.m. gongyo meeting. He plays piano for participants and takes countless photographs despite his hand becoming red and swollen.

At the Kansai Makiguchi Memorial Hall that evening, Shin'ichi creates calligraphy reading "May 3" with significant dates: 1951 (Toda's inauguration), 1960 (his own), and future milestones in 1983 and 2001.

## Launching Out 28

On May 4, Shin'ichi attends a gongyo meeting for Tottori Prefecture members at the Kansai Toda Memorial Auditorium. The chapter was established on his inauguration date in 1960, making this their 20th anniversary.

He addresses members as "noble Bodhisattvas of the Earth" and emphasizes: "All adversity is just a step toward achieving a state of boundless happiness."

## Launching Out 29

Shin'ichi attends four Osaka Prefecture chapter leaders meetings celebrating the Kansai Culture Center's opening. Between sessions, he photographs university group members and shakes hands with numerous leaders.

His guidance emphasizes health, vitality, and recognizing that adversity enables karmic transformation. He stresses: "steadfast faith—an unflagging, lifelong commitment to remain part of the movement for kosen-rufu—is the key to great victory in life."

## Launching Out 30

On May 5, Soka Gakkai Successors Day, Shin'ichi meets with representatives from youth divisions at the Kansai Culture Center. He addresses young members about personal development, parental appreciation, and building solid foundations through patience.
