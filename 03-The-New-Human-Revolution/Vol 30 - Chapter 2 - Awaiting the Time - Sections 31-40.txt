# Volume 30: Chapter 2, Awaiting the Time 31–40

## Key Themes

This section explores principles of unity and organizational leadership within the Soka Gakkai movement, centered on teachings about "many in body, one in mind."

### Unity and Diversity (Sections 31-33)

Shin'ichi discusses how organizations must balance different opinions while maintaining cohesion. He explains that as long as decisions follow democratic processes, members should support outcomes even when their preferences weren't chosen. The core principle involves respecting individual differences while uniting toward shared goals.

The Nichiren Daishonin's teaching states: "All disciples and lay supporters...should chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo with the spirit of many in body but one in mind" (paraphrased from section 32). This metaphor compares organizational strength to castle walls built from stones of varied shapes that interlock for stability.

### Internal Threats (Section 34)

Shin'ichi warns that self-centeredness undermines movements more than external opposition. Those who prioritize personal advancement over collective mission ultimately lose trust and separate from the organization. He references the Daishonin's concept of "worms born of the lion's body"—internal threats from disciples themselves.

### Leadership Through Mentorship (Section 35)

Shin'ichi reflects on his mentor Josei Toda's strict guidance, comparing it to testing lion cubs. He emphasizes that firm mentorship demonstrates compassion and commitment to developing genuine successors.

### Arakawa Campaign (Sections 36-40)

The final sections describe December 1979 activities, including encouragement for members in Tokyo's Arakawa Ward and attendance at a Fife and Drum Corps performance celebrating youth and cultural activities oriented toward building an age centered on people's happiness.
