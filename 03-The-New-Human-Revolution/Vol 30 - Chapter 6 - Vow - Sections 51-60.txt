# Volume 30: Chapter 6, Vow 51–60

## Vow 51
In summer 1990, Soka Gakkai youth members prepared a culture festival at the head temple celebrating Taiseki-ji's 700th anniversary. The September 2 event featured performances by arts and youth divisions, with members from 67 countries parading in traditional costumes. Honorary President Shin'ichi Yamamoto attended alongside High Priest Nikken. The text notes that no one anticipated the priesthood's December plot to drive a wedge between Yamamoto and members and destroy the organization.

Following the festival, Yamamoto engaged in numerous meetings with international figures, including Chinese delegates, UN officials, and cultural leaders, advancing his vision for worldwide kosen-rufu and world peace.

## Vow 52
On September 21, Yamamoto visited South Korea for the first time, attending the opening of a Western oil painting exhibition from the Tokyo Fuji Art Museum at Seoul's Ho-Am Gallery. He viewed this as cultural repayment for Korea's historical contributions to Japan and as fostering mutual understanding between nations.

After departing Seoul on September 22, Yamamoto traveled through Kyushu prefectures before returning to Tokyo on October 2. He then attended the 700th anniversary grand ceremony sessions at Taiseki-ji on October 6-7, where the Soka Gakkai's donated chandelier—an eight-petaled lotus measuring 5.4 meters in diameter—was lit in the Grand Reception Hall.

## Vow 53
High Priest Nikken praised the Soka Gakkai's achievements during the anniversary ceremony, stating: "In particular, the rise of the lay organization the Soka Gakkai in recent years has led to the correct teaching spreading throughout Japan and the world."

After the ceremonies concluded, Nikken presented Yamamoto with a certificate of appreciation and commemorative items. However, "it was only a short time later that Nikken and his supporters set into motion their plot to destroy the Soka Gakkai."

Yamamoto continued engaging with global leaders in peace, culture, and education during this period, building bridges toward the 21st century following the Cold War's end.

## Vow 54
On December 13, Yamamoto met with Sverre Lodgaard of the Peace Research Institute Oslo to discuss environmental security and human revolution. Simultaneously, a priesthood-Soka Gakkai liaison session occurred in Tokyo, where the priesthood presented written questions about Yamamoto's November 16 speech on spreading teachings and developing as a world religious movement.

The priesthood criticized Yamamoto's proposal for large-scale performances of Beethoven's "Ode to Joy," claiming that "singing 'Ode to Joy' in German constitutes praise for the Christian God."

## Vow 55
On December 23, the Soka Gakkai responded to the priesthood's inquiry, seeking clarification on matters troubling their relationship. They raised nine points including statements by the high priest and priestly misconduct.

The priesthood's December 26 response condemned the Gakkai's letter as containing "baseless accusations" and "absolutely shameless."

On December 27, the priesthood revised Nichiren Shoshu rules, limiting the chief representative term to five years and other lay officers to three years. They immediately revoked the positions of Yamamoto and other senior Gakkai leaders. This action was announced to media on December 28, before official notification reached those affected.

## Vow 56
Soka Gakkai members learned through newspapers that Yamamoto and senior leaders had been removed from their positions through rule revisions. They reacted with surprise and anger at the priesthood's actions.

The official removal notice arrived December 29. The Gakkai held emergency leaders meetings throughout Japan to explain the situation.

In 1991, designated the Year of Peace and Development, Yamamoto composed New Year's poems emphasizing "dauntless courage" and overcoming "jealousy's tempests." Soka Gakkai members held spirited New Year's gongyo meetings in Japan and 75 countries worldwide.

## Vow 57
On January 2, President Akizuki and General Director Morikawa requested a meeting with Nikken but were refused. Nichiren Shoshu declared the Gakkai leaders "unworthy of an audience."

A January 12 priesthood letter acknowledged several errors and retracted some questions, collapsing their argument's foundation. Yet they refused to amend their actions against the Soka Gakkai, asserting that promoting "equality between priests and laity" constituted "one of the five cardinal sins."

The Soka Gakkai demanded a public apology and continued requesting dialogue, citing Nichiren Daishonin's teaching to "discuss the question at length."

## Vow 58
The Soka Gakkai's commitment to dialogue reflects its philosophy respecting all people and faith in humanity, grounded in Nichiren Buddhism's egalitarian principles teaching that "all people equally possess the Buddha nature."

The priesthood, conversely, subscribed to attitudes from Japan's traditional parish system regarding priests as superior to lay followers, seeking to subjugate Soka Gakkai members to Nichiren Shoshu authority.

The Lotus Sutra teaches equality, overturning discrimination. Nichiren Daishonin affirmed: "Anyone who teaches others even a single phrase of the Lotus Sutra is the envoy of the Thus Come One, whether that person be priest or layman, nun or laywoman."

The priesthood's dogmatic attitude extended beyond rejecting Beethoven's composition to criticizing photographs of British ceremonial dress containing Christian symbols, demonstrating cultural insensitivity that obstracted mutual understanding.

## Vow 59
All human endeavors—culture, arts, customs, and traditions—have been influenced by religion. Western calendars, Sunday holidays, stained glass, and architectural styles all reflect Christian heritage. Rejecting all such elements would make functioning in society impossible.

Buddhism teaches adapting to local customs and times, respecting present traditions in each country provided they don't violate core principles. As long as practitioners uphold the Gohonzon, engage in faith and practice, and dedicate themselves to kosen-rufu, they should maintain flexible attitudes toward local culture.

Schiller's "Ode to Joy" uses the plural "gods," not praising a particular deity. Shin'ichi proposed performing this work with 50,000 members on the Gakkai's 65th anniversary and 100,000 on the 70th, eventually singing it in German alongside Japanese.

## Vow 60
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and its "Ode to Joy" symbolize freedom and unity globally. The 1989 Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia featured the composition celebrating the end of communist rule. December 1989 Berlin concerts reuniting musicians from East and West Germany, plus allied nations, performed the symphony celebrating German reunification.

Scholars refuted the priesthood's objection. Professor Haruo Kawabata noted: "Art is a sublimation of the universal human spirit. To subject it to the categories of petty religious dogmatism and condemn its appreciators as heretics is an example of the narrow-minded self-righteousness that produced the witch-hunts of former eras."

Schiller's use of plural "gods" referenced ancient Greek ideals representing humanity's highest qualities, not Christian monotheism.
