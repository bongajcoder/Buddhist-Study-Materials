# Volume 30: Chapter 1, Great Mountain 1–10

## Great Mountain 1

Nichiren Daishonin emphasized that disciples should dedicate themselves to propagating the Lotus Sutra. The Soka Gakkai members work toward worldwide kosen-rufu—the spread of Buddhism globally—by bringing happiness to those around them through genuine human connection.

Shin'ichi Yamamoto and a Soka Gakkai delegation departed India on February 16, 1979, arriving in Hong Kong to conclude his final overseas trip before the Seven Bells concluded on May 3, 1979. During his visit, he focused on building educational and cultural bridges between Soka University and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, believing such exchanges were essential for 21st-century world peace.

A Southeast Asia representatives conference gathered 65 members from nine countries and two territories on February 18. These pioneers had overcome tremendous obstacles and language barriers to establish Buddhism in their regions despite deep anti-Japanese sentiment following World War II. Their commitment represented the essence of kosen-rufu—expanding happiness through individual dedication and dialogue, one person at a time.

Shin'ichi addressed the leaders about essential qualities for advancing kosen-rufu. He emphasized that "all our members possess the respectworthy life state of Buddhahood" and reminded them that while organizational roles exist, all people remain fundamentally equal. He urged them to avoid personal profit-seeking, keep member happiness as the primary goal, and maintain democratic, harmonious governance.

Shin'ichi stressed the importance of unity grounded in faith rather than emotion. He called leaders to develop "big hearts," becoming pillars of spiritual support in their societies. He acknowledged inevitable obstacles—opposition, betrayal, internal conflict—but encouraged them to view adversity as opportunity for spiritual growth and expanded kosen-rufu.

On February 19, Shin'ichi met with Hong Kong's Governor Sir Murray MacLehose. Their discussion centered on educational exchange enabling young people to "forge friendships, freely exchange their thoughts on the world's future" across national and cultural boundaries. That afternoon, 556 members performed at a culture festival celebrating human harmony and peace aspirations for Asia.

The festival finale symbolized genuine unity, with performers of diverse backgrounds—Chinese, British, Japanese—singing together in solidarity. In eighteen years, the Hong Kong membership had grown substantially, enabling such large-scale cultural expression. Shin'ichi reflected that "building world peace is our mission" but stressed it emerges through expanding "circles of friendship and trust" within communities.

Returning to Japan on February 20, Shin'ichi intensified his activities, writing articles, encouraging members, and conducting guidance tours across multiple prefectures. Meanwhile, Nichiren Shoshu priests renewed attacks on the Soka Gakkai despite previous agreements about priesthood-laity harmony. The organization faced renewed scrutiny and criticism from institutional religious authorities.

## Great Mountain 8

By early 1979, tensions escalated when Vice President Genji Samejima made controversial statements at a March 6 meeting in Fukuoka, claiming the priesthood operated from "jealousy" and describing the head temple dismissively. The priesthood seized on these remarks as evidence the Soka Gakkai lacked sincerity, sending formal letters of inquiry and protest to organizational leadership.

As Soka Gakkai president, Shin'ichi became the primary target of priestly complaints. The Hokkeko Federation formally called for his removal as chief representative of Nichiren Shoshu lay organizations. Demands for his resignation intensified from both priests and former members who had become critics. The organization faced its most serious institutional challenge yet.

During memorial services commemorating Josei Toda's death on April 2, Shin'ichi renewed his commitment to his mentor's vision. Reflecting on the priesthood's persistent attacks despite the Gakkai's efforts at reconciliation, he recognized a fundamental philosophical divide: Nichiren Shoshu maintained hierarchical priest-superiority traditions, while "Nichiren Buddhism is a teaching of equality that demolishes discriminatory barriers."
