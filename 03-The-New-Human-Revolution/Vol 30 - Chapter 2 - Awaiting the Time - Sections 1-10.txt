# Volume 30: Chapter 2, Awaiting the Time 1–10

## Overview

This section from *The New Human Revolution* chronicles Shin'ichi Yamamoto's activities following his resignation as Soka Gakkai president in May 1979. Rather than withdrawing, he intensifies his focus on dialogue—both with international leaders and Soka Gakkai members—to advance worldwide kosen-rufu (Buddhist propagation).

## Key Themes

**Dialogue as Foundation for Peace**
The opening poem emphasizes dialogue's transformative power: "Through dialogue, we link hearts and unite the world, building a fortress of lasting peace forever unassailable."

**Mentorship and Succession**
Yamamoto deliberately distances himself from headquarters to allow new leadership under President Kiyoshi Jujo to develop independently, comparing his approach to a legendary Chinese lion testing its cubs through challenge.

**International Outreach**
Yamamoto meets with diplomatic representatives from China, the Soviet Union, Africa, and other nations, believing the 21st century will belong to Africa and that lasting peace requires building grassroots international friendships.

**Institutional Tensions**
Despite official directives from Nichiren Shoshu leadership, younger priests continue criticizing the Soka Gakkai. High Priest Nittatsu dies in July 1979, and his successor, Shinno Abe, is named the 67th high priest.

**Personal Mission**
During an August visit to Karuizawa—where his mentor Josei Toda spent his final summer—Yamamoto resolves to chronicle Toda's post-war accomplishments in a biographical novel, continuing the mentor-disciple spirit.
