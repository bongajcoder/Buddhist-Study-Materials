# Volume 30: Chapter 2, Awaiting the Time 51–60

## Awaiting the Time 51
A joint leaders meeting between Kanagawa and Shikoku members takes place at the Kanagawa Culture Center. Nearly nine months have passed since Shin'ichi resigned as Soka Gakkai president. The Shikoku members traveled despite turbulent conditions to meet their mentor, demonstrating their seeking spirit and unity in faith.

## Awaiting the Time 52
Shin'ichi addresses Shikoku men's leaders about respectful guidance. He explains that mentor Josei Toda's scolding served three purposes: training disciples for greater responsibility, helping members overcome obstacles to faith, and protecting the organization's unity. He emphasizes that leaders must always show compassion when correcting members.

## Awaiting the Time 53
Shin'ichi engages members in conversation about their lives and leadership challenges. He stresses that leaders must respect members' wishes while patiently encouraging even those resistant to practice. The group performs gongyo together, followed by dinner discussions and performances by various divisions.

## Awaiting the Time 54
Shin'ichi plays several piano pieces for the gathered members, including songs evoking mentor-disciple bonds and the courage needed to advance kosen-rufu during adversity. The evening concludes with the Shikoku members departing by ship, with over 200 Kanagawa members gathering on the pier to see them off with songs and cheers.

## Awaiting the Time 55
As the ship departs, Shin'ichi and his wife wave flashlights from the culture center's top floor to bid farewell. The Shikoku members respond emotionally from the deck. Shin'ichi chants for their safe voyage and later phones to confirm their well-being, viewing his disciples as his greatest treasure.

## Awaiting the Time 56
About a month later, eighty-six young women's division members from Amami Oshima in Kyushu travel to Tokyo's Tachikawa Culture Center. A year earlier, Shin'ichi had encouraged their leader to organize this visit. Despite Shin'ichi's resignation as president, the young women achieved significant victories spreading Buddhism in their challenging island communities.

## Awaiting the Time 57
The narrative recounts the history of Amami Oshima members, who faced severe persecution including confiscated religious objects and social exclusion. Rei Osada, the young women's division leader, grew up witnessing her mother's steadfast practice despite poverty and opposition. These experiences shaped her unwavering commitment to kosen-rufu.

## Awaiting the Time 58
When a Nichiren Shoshu priest's wife attempts to pressure Rei to abandon the Soka Gakkai, Rei responds with conviction about the organization's role in her family's spiritual development. The young women's fighting spirit carries forward this legacy of perseverance.

## Awaiting the Time 59
The young women depart Amami Oshima on February 15, traveling by ferry and airplane to Tokyo. Upon arrival, they visit the Soka Young Women's Center on a cold evening. Shin'ichi had arranged warm red bean soup for members unaccustomed to Tokyo's winter temperatures, demonstrating his attentive care.

## Awaiting the Time 60
Shin'ichi welcomes the Amami young women warmly, encouraging them to honor the pioneering efforts of earlier members. He gives special attention to a member with cerebral palsy in a wheelchair, assuring her: "Everything's going to be all right now." She had worked to improve her mobility specifically to make this journey and meet her mentor, ultimately achieving personal triumph through faith.
