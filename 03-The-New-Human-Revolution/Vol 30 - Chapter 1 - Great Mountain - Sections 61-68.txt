# Volume 30: Chapter 1, Great Mountain 61–68

## Summary

This section documents a pivotal moment in Soka Gakkai history on May 3, 1979, when Shin'ichi Yamamoto stepped down as president after 19 years of leadership. The narrative captures the tension surrounding this transition, marked by strained relations with Nichiren Shoshu priests.

## Key Events

**The General Meeting**
The 40th Soka Gakkai Headquarters General Meeting commemorated completion of the "Seven Bells"—seven seven-year development periods since the organization's 1930 founding. The atmosphere was notably subdued compared to typical gatherings, with priests displaying dismissive attitudes and leaders instructing members to suppress their usual enthusiastic responses.

**Shin'ichi's Resolve**
Despite restrictions on his activities and the priesthood's apparent antagonism, Shin'ichi remained committed to supporting members. He referenced the Daishonin's teaching: "Let the gods forsake me. Let all persecutions assail me. Still I will give my life for the sake of the Law" to emphasize unwavering dedication to kosen-rufu (spreading Buddhism).

**Artistic Expression**
That evening, Shin'ichi created calligraphy expressing his vows, including works titled "Great Mountain" and "Justice," symbolizing steadfast commitment regardless of circumstances.

**New Beginning**
On May 5, from Yokohama's harbor, Shin'ichi contemplated the Soka Gakkai's future global expansion, viewing it as embarking on a "grand new voyage" into worldwide kosen-rufu.
