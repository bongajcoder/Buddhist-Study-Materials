# Volume 30: Chapter 5, Cheers of Victory 41–50

## Cheers of Victory 41

Shin'ichi spent December 11 at the Oita Peace Center encouraging members and creating calligraphies for various groups, incorporating names with characters expressing wishes for brilliant growth and steadfast resolve.

He referenced historical figures connected to Oita—including a feudal lord who introduced Western culture, a Confucian scholar who founded an academy, a composer, and an educator—before articulating the Soka Gakkai's unique mission: spreading Nichiren Buddhism's transformative teachings globally and ensuring their eternal transmission.

Shin'ichi emphasized that personal criticism was irrelevant; his focus remained on members achieving happiness and benefits through faith. He expressed desire to visit Taketa the next morning before proceeding to Kumamoto, recognizing the severe hardships members endured during the priesthood conflict.

On December 12, he met with regional leaders and stressed the importance of supporting and treasuring members who sacrificed greatly for the movement's development.

The journey to Taketa included historical context about Oka Castle—built in 1185 by a nobleman loyal to Minamoto Yoshitsune, later protected by a young lord during sixteenth-century conflict. The castle inspired composer Rentaro Taki's famous composition, which Shin'ichi connected to members' "dauntless fighting spirit" in protecting the Law.

Approximately 50 local representatives met with Shin'ichi at a restaurant, sharing experiences of priests' betrayal. One district lost 32 of 45 households when members were persuaded to leave, yet leaders persisted in encouraging members throughout scattered mountain communities.

About 300 members gathered at the castle's main enclosure, creating an emotionally resonant atmosphere. Shin'ichi arranged a commemorative photograph and led members in singing "Moon over the Ruined Castle," sharing the emotional weight of their collective victory over adversity.

As members sang together, their resilience shone through. Shin'ichi raised his arms in a victory salute, and members responded with three cheers announcing a new era centered on ordinary people rather than institutional authority.

The ruined castle—once symbolizing impermanence and decline—transformed into a beacon of hope and eternal happiness.

Members crowded around the departing bus, calling out farewells and affirmations. Shin'ichi waved from the window, maintaining the invisible yet firm bond of faith connecting him with disciples committed to widespread Buddhist practice.

Approaching the Shiragiku Auditorium in Kumamoto, Shin'ichi observed three kites displaying a sunrise, lion, and young eagle—symbols he connected to the auditorium's location.

At the Kumamoto meeting, Shin'ichi encountered Hironori Nonaka, a high school student with muscular dystrophy. His mother, Fumino, had overcome hesitation about discussing Buddhism with others after witnessing her son's renewed commitment to practice, successfully introducing another parent to the faith.

Shin'ichi encouraged Nonaka personally, stroking his shoulder and affirming: those refusing to surrender to weakness demonstrate true victory.

## Cheers of Victory 49

Nonaka received roses from Shin'ichi the following day, filling him with gratitude. Despite a prognosis of limited lifespan, he resolved to live fully and fulfill his purpose, eventually inspiring peers through presentations about courage and hope despite his illness.

Shin'ichi delivered guidance comparing life's journey to aircraft flight: youth resembles takeoff, maturity represents steady cruising, and final years constitute the crucial landing phase toward attaining enlightenment.

He concluded that remaining young at heart while aging, pursuing Buddhist practice wholeheartedly, and helping others achieve happiness represents life's culminating victory. He praised members' sincere efforts, noting the white chrysanthemums' beauty and expressing appreciation for their dedication.

Shin'ichi composed poetry honoring both Kumamoto's young women and Taketa's members before emphasizing personal guidance—earnest dialogue revitalizing individuals at profound depths—as essential for sustained organizational development.
