# Volume 30: Chapter 5, Cheers of Victory 71–80

## Cheers of Victory 71

A man named Sato joined the Soka Gakkai and became deeply involved in activities. His in-laws, who held leadership positions, visited Akita regularly despite the 12-hour journey, teaching members the fundamentals of faith through personal guidance.

In 1954, the first large group in Akita was established with 800 households. Two years later, it became Akita Chapter, with Sato appointed as chapter leader and his sister Tetsuyo as chapter women's leader.

Sato operated a drilling business. In January 1955, Josei Toda asked him to search for groundwater at the head temple, where finding safe drinking water had become urgent. Despite months of drilling to 200 meters in various locations, Sato found nothing. Toda explained that water was needed to support the priesthood and protect members as "children of the Buddha."

Sato continued chanting with determination. Eventually, he struck water at just 26 meters depth—a miraculous discovery. The water flowed at 216 liters per minute, enabling the temple to provide water throughout its grounds.

In January 1979, Shin'ichi visited Akita and met with Sato, who had been diagnosed with lung cancer two years prior. Shin'ichi encouraged him: "Make the closing chapter of your life like a magnificent, radiant sunset."

Sato rose to the challenge, visiting members' homes and offering guidance. He died the following May at age 66, three years after diagnosis, "demonstrating the Buddhist principle of prolonging one's life through faith."

Over a year later, Shin'ichi visited Sato's family, performing gongyo and praising Sato's "fine character and wholehearted faith."

Shin'ichi spoke warmly to the family about continuing Sato's legacy, describing it as "a relay race" where they must keep running to reach the finish line. He encouraged them to demonstrate "actual proof" so others would recognize the Sato family's commitment.

On January 11, Shin'ichi addressed an Akita Prefecture conference at the Culture Center, discussing what constitutes genuine Buddhist practice: maintaining a spirit that says, "Whatever happens, I will sit before the Gohonzon and chant," while remaining centered on kosen-rufu.

He warned against those who become self-centered and use faith for selfish purposes, noting that "their true nature is always exposed in the end."

Shin'ichi shared candidly about being deceived by people over his decades of practice, yet choosing to embrace them with tolerance. However, he emphasized that those acting with ill intent—"causing suffering to fellow members" and "undermining the movement"—must be resolutely opposed.

He explained that all actions are governed by cause and effect, the fundamental law of Buddhism. He then addressed criticism from priests and others, noting that distorted perspectives cannot perceive the Soka Gakkai truthfully, comparing this to how "evil people saw Shakyamuni Buddha" with twisted perception.

After speaking, Shin'ichi acknowledged Tomiko Sekiya, a women's division guidance leader. He recalled her courageous stand in February 1978 when priests tried preventing Soka Gakkai members from entering the temple. Sekiya boldly questioned their actions and defended the organization despite having no senior mentors to consult.

Shin'ichi praised her conviction, stating: "Being an onlooker rather than someone who takes personal initiative...is a mark of cowardice."

Shin'ichi told Sekiya they would meet many times before the year 2001, when she would be 81. He promised: "Your name will shine forever in the history of kosen-rufu."

He later sent her a poem about living together into the new century "as Bodhisattvas of the Earth."

The next day, a prefecture leaders meeting celebrated the Culture Center opening. Representatives from Oita Prefecture attended, and the two prefectures agreed to form a sister relationship and build a "rainbow bridge of kosen-rufu."

Shin'ichi emphasized that the fundamental purpose of Buddhist practice is achieving personal happiness, which comes through faith and Soka Gakkai activities.

Shin'ichi reflected on memory, explaining that most fade with time, but "memories of practicing Buddhism...will endure...as the very best for all eternity." He cited the Daishonin: "Single-mindedly chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and urge others to do the same."

He described his own experiences leading campaigns and mentioned his desire for all members to participate in gongyo sessions. He decided to hold multiple sessions the next day, open to everyone.

Snow fell on January 13 as Akita members gathered from across the prefecture. After attending a morning conference, Shin'ichi returned to join members for photographs in the park.

The Akita members had endured significant hardships. Anti-Soka Gakkai priests demanded members leave the organization in exchange for funeral services and delivered vitriolic speeches at funerals. Some cruelly asserted the deceased had not attained Buddhahood.

Despite these trials, members now embarked on a new journey toward the 21st century alongside Shin'ichi.

Approximately 1,500 members gathered as Shin'ichi arrived in a white parka in minus 2.2 degrees Celsius weather. He suggested they sing the "Song of Human Revolution" as "a declaration of Akita's great victory."

After the song, he proposed a victory cheer. Members raised their voices powerfully, celebrating their triumph as snow fell around them "like a whirling shower of blossoms."

The afternoon gongyo session emphasized that faith, practice, and study form the basics of Nichiren Buddhism. Shin'ichi announced the formation of an Akita Educators Group and praised the Ota Area members for their exceptional progress in kosen-rufu.

Joryo Komatsuda was the first district leader in Ota Area. He learned about Nichiren Buddhism in 1953 from his son, who had encountered it in Tokyo. Joryo's wife suffered poor health, and his eldest son had experienced tragic losses.

Though financially comfortable, Joryo felt dejected. Learning about cause and effect through Nichiren Buddhism, he, his wife, and eldest son became the area's first three Soka Gakkai members.

As his wife practiced regularly, her health improved and laughter filled their home. Inspired by the members' positive spirits, Joryo became convinced of faith's power and eagerly shared Buddhism with others, beginning with a cousin.

By his 10th year of practice, 47 families connected to him had joined, and the southern prefecture membership reached approximately 4,700 households.

In 1963, Joryo's ancestral home burned while he was away. Some questioned how such a disaster could happen to a sincere practitioner. Joryo responded with confidence: "I'm fine, so don't worry. I have the Gohonzon!"
