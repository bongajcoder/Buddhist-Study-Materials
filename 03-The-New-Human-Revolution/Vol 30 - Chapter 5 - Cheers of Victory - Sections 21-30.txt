# Volume 30: Chapter 5, Cheers of Victory 21–30

## Overview

This section from "The New Human Revolution" documents Shin'ichi Yamamoto's guidance to Soka Gakkai youth and his visit to Oita Prefecture during a period of conflict with opposition priests.

## Key Themes

**Youth Leadership and Mission**
Shin'ichi emphasizes that young people embody the spirit of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth, tasked with spreading kosen-rufu (worldwide Buddhism) in an age of suffering. He calls them to courage and perseverance, stating: "Youth, be not afraid! Vanquish the 'arrogant crashing waves' and surmount all obstacles."

**Two New Songs**
The chapter chronicles the creation of two divisional songs:
- "Song of Crimson" for the young men's division, celebrating youthful vitality and determination
- "This Green Path" for young women, completed earlier on November 6

Both songs were designed to inspire youth entering the 21st century.

**Resilience Amid Persecution**
Shin'ichi visits Oita members who endured harassment from Shoshin-kai priests. He teaches that "changed poison into medicine" transforms suffering into spiritual growth, and that persevering through adversity strengthens one's faith and capacity for happiness.

**Mentor-Disciple Bond**
Throughout, Shin'ichi emphasizes the importance of unwavering commitment to principles, regardless of criticism or changing circumstances, exemplifying the mentor-disciple relationship as central to Buddhist practice.
