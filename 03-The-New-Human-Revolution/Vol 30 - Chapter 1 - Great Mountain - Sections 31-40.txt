# Volume 30: Chapter 1, Great Mountain 31–40

## Great Mountain 31

The Soka Gakkai represents assembled Bodhisattvas of the Earth working to realize kosen-rufu, the mission entrusted by Nichiren Daishonin to his followers. The organization's first two presidents—Tsunesaburo Makiguchi and Josei Toda—devoted themselves to spreading the Law and advancing human happiness. Their successors continue this legacy with commitment to spreading the Mystic Law.

On April 16, 1979, Shin'ichi Yamamoto met with former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger at the House of International Friendship in Tokyo. Though their last meeting occurred four years prior, they renewed their connection and discussed paths toward lasting peace. Kissinger, born in Germany in 1923, had escaped Nazi persecution and later became a prominent diplomat under President Richard Nixon, serving as national security advisor and secretary of state. His work included facilitating U.S.-China relations, arms limitation talks, Vietnam peace negotiations, and Middle East diplomacy. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973 and subsequently taught at Georgetown University following Jimmy Carter's 1977 presidential inauguration.

During their extended conversation, Kissinger shared details about his forthcoming memoir, focusing on diplomatic accomplishments rather than personal matters. Shin'ichi emphasized that "actual efforts and accomplishments are what matter most" in both diplomacy and personal development.

Their discussion ranged across numerous subjects, including influential figures in their lives, messages for youth, and contemporary global situations. When war threats arose as a topic, Shin'ichi stressed that peace-promoting philosophies and religions remain essential. Kissinger concurred completely.

Shin'ichi referenced King Ashoka's reign in India and Buddhism's role in establishing peaceful governance. He explained that Ashoka succeeded by basing his government on Buddhism's principle that all people possess Buddha nature—"the supreme and incomparable life state of Buddhahood." This teaching grounds respect for human dignity and equality, fostering philosophies valuing peace and humanism.

Recognizing they needed extensive time to explore their topics thoroughly, both agreed to meet again. This materialized in September 1986 through two consecutive days of dialogue, continued via correspondence, and serialized in the Soka Gakkai magazine *Ushio* from January through August 1987. That September, it was published as *Heiwa to Jinsei to Tetsugaku wo Kataru* (Discussions on Peace, Life, and Philosophy).

Shin'ichi resolved to communicate Buddhist philosophy centered on respecting life's dignity and universal human equality—principles suitable for guiding the twenty-first century toward peace. On April 20, marking the 28th anniversary of the *Seikyo Shimbun* (Soka Gakkai's daily newspaper), he met with *Indian Express* Editor-in-Chief S. Mulgaokar at Kanagawa Culture Center, discussing peace promotion and journalism's role.

Focusing on global peace realization, Shin'ichi engaged leaders and thinkers worldwide while maintaining personal member encouragement through home visits and guidance. At Kanagawa Culture Center, he greeted and spoke with dozens of visiting members, offering words of encouragement.

He resolved to perpetually support fellow members and walk alongside ordinary, hardworking people regardless of circumstances or position. Personal encouragement efforts and world peace initiatives share identical foundations: the Buddhist teaching that all people are inherently Buddhas, inspiring compassionate practice grounded in this belief.

Speaking with youth division leader Takayoshi Oga and other young people, Shin'ichi declared: "The world is your stage! Make the most of this precious life and join me in the great adventure of worldwide kosen-rufu!"

Witnessing the young people's resolve and commitment, he felt boundless hope. Shin'ichi remained acutely conscious of worldwide suffering from war, famine, poverty, and other harsh realities. Deeply pondering how to end the Cold War dividing the world, he determined to continue dialogue with world leaders as a concerned citizen, recognizing this as the sole path toward building peace despite apparent impossibility.

On April 22, Shin'ichi visited the Nichiren Shoshu head temple to meet High Priest Nittatsu. Mount Fuji stood majestically against the blue sky, snowcapped peak serene despite fierce winds—an inspiring, uplifting sight for Shin'ichi.

He had come viewing his resignation from heading all Nichiren Shoshu lay organizations and the Soka Gakkai presidency as positive for the organization's future. While his resignation aimed to protect members from unreasonable attacks by younger priests, he sensed the Seven Bells' completion heralded new dynamic growth and development. Additionally, unfinished projects requiring presidential time remained, including interfaith dialogue for peace and increased personal member encouragement, particularly visiting pioneer members at home.

Shin'ichi confirmed his resignation intention to High Priest Nittatsu, stating formal submission would occur April 26. Nittatsu responded by indicating he would subsequently appoint Shin'ichi as honorary head of all Nichiren Shoshu lay organizations.

Shin'ichi also announced plans to step down as Soka Gakkai president—held for nineteen years—coinciding with the Seven Bells' completion. He envisioned continuing to support members and pursue peace, culture, and education activities in his new role.

Since the Soka Gakkai dedicates itself to kosen-rufu and human happiness, it cannot permit progress to falter. Shin'ichi firmly resolved to begin fresh struggles in a new role while earnestly praying for the organization's continued development. He declared internally: "A way forward opens when there is one determined individual. My disciples, rise up as lions! The crucial moment is here at last!"

On April 24, the *Seikyo Shimbun* published Shin'ichi's article "Thoughts on the Completion of the Seven Bells" on its front page, coordinated with organizational leadership.

As the Seven Bells concluded, Shin'ichi wished to express gratitude toward members who had shared hardships and joys while preparing them for the organization's fresh beginning.

He began: "Walking the great path of kosen-rufu since founding president Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, we have advanced with the Seven Bells—a series of seven seven-year milestones—as progress landmarks. We are now celebrating this culmination, ending on Soka Gakkai Day, May 3, 1979."

Shin'ichi then expressed profound respect for members devoted to compassionately spreading Nichiren Buddhism.

"Twenty-one years have passed since President Toda's death, and I have been honored to serve as Soka Gakkai president for nineteen years, writing history of shared struggles and victories alongside you.

"I would like to once again express humble gratitude to all of you, valiant champions of the Mystic Law, who have striven energetically for kosen-rufu while supporting me despite my shortcomings. Please be assured that invaluable work we have achieved together will become eternal treasure in your lives.

"We are an assembly of ordinary people in the Latter Day of the Law. We have achieved progress and experienced setbacks, but we have always weathered adversity's stormy seas, created rising tides of development, and directed efforts toward consolidating those tides to realize the Daishonin's ideal of 'establishing the correct teaching for the peace of the land' and universal happiness and peace."

Shin'ichi knew without doubt that the Soka Gakkai—dedicated members working tirelessly alongside him—had opened the path for kosen-rufu through selfless spreading of the Mystic Law. He firmly believed that Bodhisattvas of the Earth had assembled under the Soka Gakkai banner to actualize the Daishonin's mandate in the Latter Day of the Law.

In his article, Shin'ichi shared his vision for humanity's future, noting that amid emerging survival threats, the Soka Gakkai's network of Bodhisattvas had expanded to more than ninety countries, with Nichiren Buddhism representing humanity's sole hope.

"We are still in very early stages of fostering peace and culture worldwide, but seeds have been sown and are beginning to sprout. The real work lies ahead, requiring us to view it as a grand vision we must accomplish as Nichiren Buddhism practitioners.

"Religion is the heart of both peace and culture, with underlying power transcending national boundaries. From ancient times, religion has given life to culture.

"Peace must be built in each person's heart's fortress. Once we have established certain foundations, we must turn history's current toward enduring culture and peace."

When religions confine themselves to religious boundaries while ignoring real-world challenges, they serve no purpose. Religion must positively change society. As Buddhists, our mission involves realizing human happiness and world peace—why Nichiren Daishonin called for "establishing the correct teaching for the peace of the land."

Leo Tolstoy (1828–1910) wrote: "But, as always, religion remains the chief motivator and heart of human societies."

Shin'ichi continued: "We have made historic progress and now see kosen-rufu's towering mountain range in the distance. We have capable people working for kosen-rufu and steady streams of young people emerging for the twenty-first century. This is extremely reassuring. We have long awaited this moment. It is victory won through faith bonds bringing together people from all walks of life—a song of human triumph."

This represented Shin'ichi's personal victory declaration. The reality of kosen-rufu achieved by the Soka Gakkai through its members remains eternal and imperishable.

Truly great accomplishments require continuous effort and future successors to continue the work.

Shin'ichi continued: "The important thing now, given that kosen-rufu is an unremitting, ongoing revolution, is how we pass the torch to the next generation. Completing one phase starts another. Each milestone must create even more magnificent historical pages.

"Day after day, month after month, I have pondered how best to develop our movement for opening a great path to the twenty-first century; securing peace and happiness for each of you; and ensuring your children carry on Nichiren Buddhism's correct teaching while your families flourish eternally. This has been my responsibility responding to contemporary challenges.

"Now our movement for substantive kosen-rufu realization has grown from a small stream into a mighty river, flowing powerfully into the vast ocean."

Shin'ichi then wrote that he keenly felt the need to stabilize and perpetuate that mighty river's flow. He concluded by calling for members to engrave the Daishonin's assurance that kosen-rufu would be achieved "as surely as an arrow aimed at the earth cannot miss the target" deep in their hearts, renewing their vow to exert themselves in faith, practice, and study—Nichiren Buddhism's basics.

Those reading Shin'ichi's article that morning felt his deep gratitude and fresh-start resolve, inspiring renewed personal determinations.

No one imagined his presidential resignation would be announced that very day.

In fact, members began joyfully. April 22's final round of nationwide local assembly elections had concluded, with April 23's vote counting showing the Soka Gakkai–backed Komei Party achieving major victory.

## Great Mountain 38

At 10:00 a.m. on April 24, a Soka Gakkai prefecture leaders meeting convened at Shinjuku Culture Center, approximately ten minutes' walk from Soka Gakkai Headquarters and the Seikyo Shimbun building in Tokyo's Shinanomachi. Participants gathered from across the country looked happy and upbeat, buoyed by the Komei Party's recent election success.

Although Shin'ichi was absent, the emcee announced the meeting's start.

Soka Gakkai General Director Kiyoshi Jujo rose first to speak. The prefecture leaders meeting, preceding May 3 Soka Gakkai Day, was meant to mark organizational activities' fresh departure, but Jujo appeared grave and unsmiling.

He began discussing the Seven Bells' origins.

"At the May 3, 1958 Headquarters General Meeting, while everyone grieved President Toda's death, President Yamamoto shared the Seven Bells vision. Reaffirming President Toda's observation that approximately every seven years since founding, the Soka Gakkai reached major development milestones, he declared the time had come to ring the fifth bell—ushering in the fifth seven-year period.

"This helped us overcome grief and make fresh starts with bright future hopes, aiming for 1979—when the seventh bell would close.

"Now that series ends. President Yamamoto has already announced new development visions afterward. From 1980, we will advance kosen-rufu efforts while aiming for four five-year milestones through 2000, then begin new Seven Bells with the twenty-first century's start.

"Since his inauguration, President Yamamoto has greatly expanded kosen-rufu from a stream to a river, and a river to an ocean, implementing various changes responding to changing times. He created more democratic organizations ensuring membership will and needs inform leadership through discussion and consensus systems. In 1974, he transferred the Soka Gakkai's representative director post from the president to the general director."

Shin'ichi had worked building new organizational structures for the future. Only through appropriately responding to contemporary needs can we ensure the Soka Gakkai flourishes eternally.

## Great Mountain 39

Looking toward the future, both society and Soka Gakkai membership were certain to grow increasingly diverse. Thus, Shin'ichi felt it was even more important than before to draw upon varied opinions and ideas, ensuring the organization operated through collective leadership based on discussion and consensus. He envisioned an organization where the president played pivotal roles while executive leadership worked closely together advancing the organization.

Furthermore, he had a vision of organizations where each member shared personal responsibility for its development—as if they themselves were president—uniting with fellow members for kosen-rufu activities.

General Director Jujo continued: "President Yamamoto has implemented various organizational measures facilitating presidential effectiveness even after he is no longer in that position.

"For a long time, he has told us: 'Things are fine while I'm here, but what happens to the Gakkai when I'm gone? I want to take steps now preparing for that eventuality. I cannot remain president forever. Soon, I will need to hand over the reins and support the next president.'

"He also said: 'You are only thinking short-term, but I am looking far ahead and taking necessary steps for the future.'

"Now, seeing the Seven Bells' completion as an important movement milestone, President Yamamoto is announcing his presidential resignation."

Everyone gasped. Some doubted their ears. Others looked at Jujo dumbfounded with tears in their eyes.

Jujo was also overcome emotionally, but rallied himself: "President Yamamoto said: 'For Soka Gakkai stability, continuity, and ongoing development, we must set forth with new organizational structure and leadership lineups.' After long, careful consideration, he has decided to step down."

The mentor opens paths for disciples. Genuine disciples widen and extend those paths further. Ensuring kosen-rufu movement continuation represents the true path of mentor and disciple.

## Great Mountain 40

Shin'ichi Yamamoto's presidential resignation announcement shocked prefecture leaders meeting participants, who could not hide their surprise and confusion. They presumed he was resigning to take full responsibility for recent Nichiren Shoshu troubles and end the priesthood's Soka Gakkai attacks. When Jujo explained that Shin'ichi was voluntarily stepping down, they found it difficult accepting.

It was undeniable that priesthood troubles triggered Shin'ichi's resignation. However, Shin'ichi also strongly wished to make his resignation a positive future move.

Jujo's forehead perspired. Sensing from listeners' expressions that his explanation was insufficiently satisfying, he spoke louder: "President Yamamoto gave the following reasons for stepping down."

He then quoted from notes on Shin'ichi's explanation: "'First, having served as president for nineteen long years, I feel I am approaching my physical endurance limits. Considering Soka Gakkai long-term stability, I wish to pass the baton while still in good health. Now is perfect timing, given that Presidents Makiguchi and Toda's disciples remain prominent while capable young people are emerging steadily.

"'Second, organizational and structural reforms needed responding to society and contemporary demands—under consideration since 1970—have been steadily implemented, with new rules and regulations based on these reforms shortly being adopted. Sound deliberative and decision-making structures are now in place as the Soka Gakkai advances. I can now hand over organizational operations with an easy mind.

"'Third, in recent years, I have devoted considerable energy to promoting peace, culture, and education based on Nichiren Buddhism ideals. I feel I need to make greater efforts and blaze new trails in those areas for Japan and the world. I also would like visiting members nationwide who have worked hard for kosen-rufu and created history alongside me, and do more writing. All this requires time.'"

Jujo continued: "These are the reasons President Yamamoto cited for stepping down."

People, society, and the natural world all undergo changes. Faith in the Mystic Law and Soka Gakkai spirit drive turning those changes into catalysts for great development and growth, giving strength to embark on fresh challenges filled with hope.
