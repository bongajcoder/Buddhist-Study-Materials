# Chapter 8: The Lineage and Tradition of Buddhist Humanism

The Soka Gakkai practices Buddhist teachings originating from Shakyamuni Buddha and developed through Indian scholars Nagarjuna and Vasubandhu, Chinese teachers Tiantai and Miaole, Japanese teacher Dengyo, and Nichiren Daishonin. The organization maintains the orthodox lineage of Buddhist humanism emphasizing respect for life and all human beings, basing itself on the Lotus Sutra and adapting Buddhist practice to modern times.

## 1. Shakyamuni

Born a prince in ancient India (modern-day Nepal), Shakyamuni witnessed the unavoidable sufferings of existence—birth, aging, sickness, and death. Though surrounded by comfort and luxury, he recognized their transience and impermanence, prompting him to abandon palace life seeking a teaching that would clarify human existence's true meaning.

**Buddha—The Awakened One**

Dissatisfied with existing spiritual traditions, Shakyamuni pursued meditation to discover fundamental causes and solutions to suffering. He awakened to the eternal and universal Dharma, or Law, pervading all life and the universe. The title "Buddha" means awakened one, and "Shakyamuni" means sage of the Shakyas.

**The Wisdom to Realize the Inherent Dignity of Life**

Shakyamuni taught that people's ignorance of their inherent dignity results in egoism, causing selfish desires and harm to others. He advocated awakening to the eternal Law within, restoring people's supreme dignity and infinite potential through bringing forth inherent wisdom.

**The Compassion to Respect All People**

By helping people recognize their own value, Shakyamuni taught them to respect others' value equally. This represents basic Buddhist compassion: understanding that others deserve the same importance and care as ourselves, founded on mutual understanding and respect.

**The Lotus Sutra—The Essence of Mahayana Buddhism**

After expounding teachings for approximately fifty years, Shakyamuni's disciples compiled his words and actions into sutras. The Lotus Sutra, emphasizing compassion and wisdom, stands preeminent among Mahayana teachings. The Buddha stated that expounding this sutra fulfilled his eternal wish to elevate all people to his own life state, calling upon disciples to inherit this vow and practice compassion.

## 2. Nichiren Daishonin—The Votary of the Lotus Sutra

Regarding all people's suffering as his own, Nichiren Daishonin sought to relieve it through identifying the Buddhist teachings capable of realizing genuine happiness and establishing respect for human dignity. His extensive studies of Buddhist commentaries and sutras led him to the Lotus Sutra, which teaches how all people can express their unlimited potential in society.

Resolving to help all people realize true happiness and actualize peace and security in society, the Daishonin faced life-threatening persecution and fierce opposition. Undeterred, he remained a devoted votary of the Lotus Sutra, encouraging people even at risk to himself. He established chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and inscribed the Gohonzon as the object of faith, opening the path for all people to attain buddhahood.

In his treatise on establishing correct teaching for peace, the Daishonin asserts that social prosperity and peace are "indispensable to building individual happiness," emphasizing that people should first pray for order and tranquility throughout their land.

His lifelong focus involved establishing correct teaching for societal peace—making respect for life's dignity society's guiding principle and building a world where people live securely. This humanistic approach, grounded in reason and dialogue, sought to overcome egoism's destructive nature through fostering trust, value creation, and harmony.

## 3. The Soka Gakkai—Bringing Nichiren Buddhism to Life in Modern Times

The Soka Gakkai's three founding presidents—Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, Josei Toda, and Daisaku Ikeda—revived Nichiren Daishonin's philosophy and practice in modern times.

Members engage in personal practice by chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo to reflect deeply on their lives, developing rich character grounded in humanistic values through "human revolution." They deepen understanding by attending meetings, sharing experiences, and engaging in conversations about Buddhism's principles and ideals.

**The Westward Transmission of Buddhism and Worldwide Kosen-rufu**

Nichiren Buddhism emphasizes realizing happiness for oneself and others while contributing to communities as trustworthy citizens. The Soka Gakkai actively addresses global issues through antinuclear exhibitions, refugee support initiatives, and environmental programs promoting peace, human dignity, and life respect.

Recognizing humanistic philosophy originating with Shakyamuni and inherited by Nichiren as Buddhism's essence, the Soka Gakkai carries on this tradition through dialogue, cultivating individuals exemplifying Buddhist humanism. This movement toward human happiness and world peace is termed kosen-rufu.

Buddhism traveled eastward from India to Japan and now moves westward globally. The Soka Gakkai's humanistic Buddhist movement has spread to 192 countries and territories.

**The Three Treasures**

All Buddhists respect the Buddha, the Law (teachings), and practitioners—collectively known as the three treasures. In Nichiren's Buddhism of sowing, these treasures are revered from the perspective of "time without beginning," the fundamental dimension of existence.

The treasure of the Buddha from this perspective is Nichiren Daishonin, the eternal Buddha who revealed the fundamental Law as an ordinary person. The treasure of the Law is the Gohonzon of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. The treasure of the Buddhist Order is Nikko Shonin, the Daishonin's successor who correctly transmitted these treasures.

When revering these three treasures, practitioners receive enlightenment's seeds and attain buddhahood. The word "nam" derives from Sanskrit meaning "to devote one's life," indicating basing oneself on something and following it completely.

The Soka Gakkai represents the treasure of the Buddhist Order today, as it carries on Nichiren Daishonin's spirit and advances worldwide kosen-rufu.
