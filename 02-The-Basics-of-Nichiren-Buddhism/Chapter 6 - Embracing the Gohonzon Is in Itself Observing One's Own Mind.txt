# Chapter 6: Embracing the Gohonzon Is in Itself Observing One's Own Mind

## Introduction

Buddhist practice aims to establish absolute happiness in this lifetime—a state unaffected by external circumstances. Nichiren Daishonin inscribed the Gohonzon to enable all people to reveal the world of buddhahood within their own lives and become victors in daily affairs.

## 1. The Significance of the Gohonzon

### The Seed of Buddhahood

The Gohonzon represents the fundamental Law that constitutes the cause of enlightenment. Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is the name of this Law—the same Law that enables all people to attain buddhahood. This Mystic Law is inherently present in all living beings as the buddha nature.

When believers chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo while revering the Gohonzon, they awaken the buddha nature within their lives. As the Daishonin explains, this resembles how a caged bird's song summons birds flying in the sky to gather around.

### "I, Nichiren, Have Inscribed My Life"

Nichiren Daishonin awakened to the Mystic Law within his own life and recognized it as synonymous with buddhahood. He then expressed this realization in the Gohonzon, a mandala depicting the fundamental Law of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo that he had discovered and embodied.

The Gohonzon serves as a concrete expression of the world of buddhahood realized by an ordinary person—Nichiren Daishonin himself—making it an achievable ideal for all people.

### The Clear Mirror Reflecting One's Life

The Gohonzon functions as a mirror reflecting the buddhahood inherent in ordinary people. By believing in and praying to it, practitioners can immediately observe the world of buddhahood within their own lives, just as the Daishonin did.

### The Ceremony in the Air

Nichiren Daishonin based the Gohonzon on the Ceremony in the Air described in the Lotus Sutra—a ceremony spanning eight chapters in which Shakyamuni entrusts the Bodhisattvas of the Earth with spreading the Lotus Sutra in the evil age after his passing to save suffering people.

The Daishonin clarified that "In the Latter Day of the Law, no treasure tower exists other than the figures of the men and women who embrace the Lotus Sutra," indicating that believers themselves become the treasure tower through their practice.

Representatives of all Ten Worlds appear in the Gohonzon, making it a mandala perfectly endowed with all worlds and their attributes.

### The Actual Three Thousand Realms in a Single Moment of Life

The Gohonzon expresses the mutual possession of the Ten Worlds—the principle that a life in any world can manifest the world of buddhahood. This makes the Gohonzon a concrete, "actual" expression of the doctrine of three thousand realms in a single moment of life, in contrast to earlier theoretical formulations.

The Gohonzon is called the "banner of propagation of the Lotus Sutra," exemplifying Shakyamuni's intent to spread the Mystic Law and advance kosen-rufu—the widespread propagation of this Law.

## 2. Embracing the Gohonzon Is in Itself Observing One's Own Mind

### The Practice of Observing the Mind

Buddhist meditation traditionally focuses on observing one's own life and mind based on scriptural principles. The Great Teacher Tiantai developed this practice to help people realize that life possesses all Ten Worlds—the doctrine of three thousand realms in a single moment of life.

However, Tiantai's methods required superior capacity and intensive effort. Few achieved genuine awakening through such rigorous disciplines.

### Nichiren's Accessible Teaching

Nichiren Daishonin sought a path to buddhahood accessible to everyone. His search culminated in teaching the practice of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo with faith in the Gohonzon as the universal way to achieve genuine happiness.

Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is the fundamental Law underlying all life states. The Gohonzon reveals the true nature of all people's lives as fully endowed with the Ten Worlds.

Those who believe in and pray to the Gohonzon can directly observe the Ten Worlds operating within their own lives. This represents a crucial shift: whereas earlier Buddhist practice relied on observation of the mind, Nichiren Buddhism accomplishes this through faith in the Gohonzon.

### Benefits Encompassed in Nam-myoho-renge-kyo

The Daishonin stated that all of Shakyamuni's practices and virtues are contained within the five characters of Myoho-renge-kyo. When ordinary people embrace the Gohonzon, they receive the same benefits that Shakyamuni attained through his countless practices, making buddhahood genuinely accessible to all.
