# Chapter 2: The Ten Worlds

This chapter discusses the principle of the Ten Worlds, which classifies ten distinct states of life and forms the foundation of the Buddhist view of life. The fundamental aim of faith in Nichiren Buddhism is to reveal the state of buddhahood inherent within us.

## The Six Paths

The Ten Worlds comprise: (1) hell, (2) hungry spirits, (3) animals, (4) asuras, (5) human beings, (6) heavenly beings, (7) voice-hearers, (8) cause-awakened ones, (9) bodhisattvas, and (10) buddhas.

The first six constitute the "six paths," while the latter four are the "four noble worlds." The Lotus Sutra teaches that all Ten Worlds exist within each living being—a concept called the mutual possession of the Ten Worlds. This means any person can manifest any of these states in response to circumstances.

### The World of Hell

Hell represents the lowest life state—complete imprisonment by suffering and lack of freedom. It is characterized by rage arising from frustration and discontent, where living itself becomes extremely painful.

### The World of Hungry Spirits

This state involves relentless craving and unsatisfied desire. The suffering comes from being enslaved by insatiable wants, unable to use desires constructively.

### The World of Animals

Animality is characterized by foolish, impulsive behavior based on immediate gratification rather than reason. Those in this state cannot distinguish between right and wrong, operating under "the law of the jungle."

### The World of Asuras

Asuras are contentious demons obsessed with personal superiority. They constantly compare themselves with others, displaying arrogance towards those they consider inferior while becoming cowardly before the stronger. This state involves hypocrisy and self-deception.

### The World of Human Beings

This calm, composed state represents people maintaining their characteristic human qualities. Individuals understand cause and effect, distinguish between good and evil, and exercise self-control. However, this state requires constant effort to maintain.

### The World of Heavenly Beings

Heaven represents the joyful state experienced when desires are fulfilled through effort. This includes various desires—instinctive, material, social, intellectual, and spiritual. However, this happiness is temporary and fades with time.

## The Four Noble Worlds

The six paths are governed by external circumstances, making them unstable. The four noble worlds represent awakened states developed through Buddhist practice, offering self-determined happiness independent of external conditions.

### The Worlds of Voice-Hearers and Cause-Awakened Ones

These states, achieved through Hinayana teachings, represent partial awakening. Voice-hearers gain insight through hearing the Buddha's teaching, while cause-awakened ones awaken through personal observation. Both recognize the impermanence of all phenomena but limit themselves to lesser enlightenment and self-focused practice, failing to help others.

### The World of Bodhisattvas

Bodhisattvas seek the highest buddhahood and work altruistically to share benefits with others. The bodhisattva spirit emphasizes empathy with suffering and compassion. Unlike the people of the two vehicles, those in this world act with a sense of mission for all people.

### The World of Buddhas

Buddhahood represents the supremely noble life state of awakening to the Mystic Law. A buddha possesses unsurpassed wisdom and compassion. This state is inherent within all people but difficult to manifest in daily life. Through faith in the Gohonzon and chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, people can tap this inner buddhahood—a state of absolute happiness that nothing can destroy, often compared to the ease and confidence of a lion king.
