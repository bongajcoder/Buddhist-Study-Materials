# Chapter 7: The Mission and Practice of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth

## 1. The Mission and Awareness of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth

The Bodhisattvas of the Earth are disciples personally trained by the eternal Buddha. Shakyamuni's fundamental wish, revealed in the Lotus Sutra's "Life Span" chapter, centers on enabling all beings to attain buddhahood. This compassionate desire forms the foundation of Nichiren Buddhist practice.

In the "Emerging from the Earth" chapter, Shakyamuni summons these special bodhisattvas to propagate the Lotus Sutra in future ages. They respond by vowing to spread the Mystic Law and inherit their teacher's great mission. Through their collective effort and shared purpose, kosen-rufu—the widespread propagation of Buddhist teachings—becomes possible.

The presence of Bodhisattvas of the Earth transforms suffering into meaningful purpose. When individuals commit to this vow, they access boundless courage and wisdom. Their faith enables the conversion of the suffering-filled world into the Land of Eternally Tranquil Light.

Nichiren Daishonin identified "Nam-myoho-renge-kyo" as the essence of the Lotus Sutra and pledged to spread this teaching widely. He instructed followers: "My wish is that all my disciples make a great vow," entrusting them with achieving kosen-rufu.

The Soka Gakkai emerged in modern times as a successor to this mission. Its members function as contemporary Bodhisattvas of the Earth, dedicated to transmitting Buddhism and transforming lives through compassionate practice.

## 2. Perceiving Evil and Protecting Good

### Good Friends in Buddhist Practice

Buddhism distinguishes between "good friends"—those supporting correct practice—and "evil friends" who obstruct the path to enlightenment. The human mind easily wavers; therefore, guidance from good friends proves essential.

However, obstacles themselves serve a purpose. As one's faith strengthens, challenges intensify. By perceiving these obstacles clearly and summoning stronger faith, practitioners transform difficulties into opportunities. The Daishonin taught that even adversaries can become good friends when viewed through the lens of spiritual development.

### Strictness and Flexibility

Practitioners must strictly challenge slander of the Law—the rejection or disparagement of Buddhist teachings that benefit humanity. Such slander causes suffering and social instability.

Simultaneously, Buddhism teaches the "precept of adapting to local customs," respecting each region's culture and traditions when compatible with fundamental Buddhist principles. This flexibility reflects Buddhism's universal applicability across all cultures and times.

The key balance involves unwavering commitment to core Buddhist truth while remaining adaptable regarding cultural expression and non-essential forms.
