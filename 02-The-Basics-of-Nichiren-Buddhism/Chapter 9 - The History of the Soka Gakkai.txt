# Chapter 9: The History of the Soka Gakkai

In this chapter, we examine the Soka Gakkai's history through its three founding presidents who dedicated their lives to kosen-rufu (widespread propagation of Buddhist teachings) and the mentor-disciple relationships they shared.

## The Lotus Sutra and Kosen-rufu

The Lotus Sutra clarifies Shakyamuni Buddha's intent: enabling all people to awaken their innate buddhahood and establish lasting happiness for themselves and others, creating the foundation for world peace.

The sutra describes those striving to fulfill this intent as Bodhisattvas of the Earth. These practitioners appear in the Latter Day of the Law after Shakyamuni's passing, working to spread the Lotus Sutra globally. Nichiren Daishonin awakened to his mission as the Buddha of the Latter Day, establishing the fundamental teaching and practice for liberating all people from suffering throughout this age.

Today, the Soka Gakkai inherits the Daishonin's spirit and mission. Its three founding presidents—Tsunesaburo Makiguchi (first), Josei Toda (second), and Daisaku Ikeda (third)—firmly established modern practice and awareness for achieving kosen-rufu.

## 1. Tsunesaburo Makiguchi (First President)

**Early Life and Education**

Makiguchi was born June 6, 1871, in Niigata Prefecture. After moving to Hokkaido as a teenager, he attended Hokkaido Normal School and became a schoolteacher. In 1901, he relocated to Tokyo with manuscripts for his work on educational philosophy, eventually serving as principal at several elementary schools.

Josei Toda, born February 11, 1900, in Ishikawa Prefecture, also became an educator. After studying while working, he received his teaching certificate and began teaching in Hokkaido.

**Mentor and Disciple Meet**

When Toda visited Tokyo, he met the principal Makiguchi. The 48-year-old educator and 19-year-old teacher formed an immediate bond. Toda regarded Makiguchi as his life mentor and supported him fully.

**Taking Faith and Founding the Soka Kyoiku Gakkai**

Makiguchi's educational philosophy emphasized enabling children to create value and achieve happiness as self-sufficient members of society. Through his research, he encountered Nichiren Buddhism, recognizing it as clarifying the principles for the life transformation he sought. In 1928, at age 57, he took faith in Nichiren Shoshu Buddhism.

Makiguchi wrote of this experience: "With an indescribable joy, I completely changed the way I had lived for almost sixty years." He also noted, "Encountering the Lotus Sutra, I realized the teachings of the sutra in no way contradict the principles of philosophy and science."

Toda followed his mentor into the faith that same year.

On November 18, 1930, Makiguchi published his major work on value-creating pedagogy. The Soka Kyoiku Gakkai (Value-Creating Education Society) appeared as the publisher, marking the organization's public founding. The name reflects Makiguchi's conviction that value creation is integral to building happiness. The concept emerged from discussions between the mentor and disciple.

**Independent Practice and Growth**

Unlike traditional lay Buddhist societies affiliated with temples, the Soka Kyoiku Gakkai operated independently under Makiguchi and Toda's leadership. It emphasized Buddhist practice accessible to everyone, aimed at actualizing happiness amid life's challenges and contributing to social peace and prosperity. Through discussion meetings and regional guidance, membership grew to approximately three thousand.

**Resisting Militarism**

Japan's militarist government, using State Shinto as its ideological pillar, pressured citizens to visit shrines and revere talismans to the Sun Goddess. In June 1943, Nichiren Shoshu priests requested the Soka Kyoiku Gakkai accept the Shinto talisman—essentially complying with government demands that contradicted Buddhist teachings.

Makiguchi adamantly refused, upholding the Daishonin's principle of admonishing slander of the Law. On July 6, 1943, he and Toda were arrested by the Special Higher Police on charges of lèse-majesté and violating the Peace Preservation Law. Most arrested members abandoned their faith under coercive interrogation, but Makiguchi and Toda persisted, even explaining Buddhist teachings to their prosecutors.

On November 18, 1944—coincidentally the founding anniversary—Makiguchi died at the Tokyo Detention Center at age 73, weakened by malnutrition. He lived as a noble pioneer, never hesitating to risk his life for the Daishonin's teachings.

**Toda's Prison Awakening**

While imprisoned, Toda intensely chanted and studied the Lotus Sutra. By early 1944, he experienced profound awakening: recognizing that Buddha is life itself, and realizing he was a Bodhisattva of the Earth entrusted with spreading the sutra's teachings in the Latter Day of the Law.

In November 1944, Toda awakened to the conviction: "I, Toda, am a Bodhisattva of the Earth," whose mission was achieving kosen-rufu. This awakening became the primary inspiration for reviving Buddhism in modern times and driving the Soka Gakkai's progress.

At Makiguchi's memorial service after the war, Toda expressed gratitude: the bond between mentor and disciple enabled him to understand his role as a Bodhisattva of the Earth and absorb the sutra's meaning with his entire being.

## 2. Josei Toda (Second President)

**Reconstruction and Vision**

On July 3, 1945, Toda emerged from prison after two years of confinement, standing alone to carry on Makiguchi's will. As general director, he began immediately reconstructing the devastated organization.

Japan lay in despair after wartime destruction. State Shinto, once imposed, was repudiated along with militarist values, yet no new source of hope emerged. Toda was convinced that only Nichiren Buddhism possessed sufficient spiritual power to lead people from suffering and confusion. He vowed to spread its teachings widely.

He renamed the organization from Soka Kyoiku Gakkai (Value-Creating Education Society) to Soka Gakkai (Value-Creating Society), expanded its purpose to include worldwide peace and universal happiness, and resumed discussion meetings and regional guidance.

**Meeting Daisaku Ikeda**

In 1947, Toda met young Daisaku Ikeda, who would become the third president. Ikeda was born January 2, 1928, in Tokyo's Ota Ward.

Growing up during Japan's military expansion, Ikeda witnessed war's devastation firsthand. His four older brothers were drafted; his eldest was killed in Burma. His family lost their home to air raids. Through these experiences and his study of literature and philosophy, he developed deep conviction that war was evil.

On August 14, 1947, Ikeda attended his first Soka Gakkai discussion meeting, where Toda was lecturing on a Daishonin writing about establishing correct teaching for the land's peace. Afterward, Ikeda asked penetrating questions: "What is the correct way to live?"; "What is a true patriot?"; "What is Nam-myoho-renge-kyo?"; and "What do you think about the Emperor?"

Toda's clear, well-reasoned answers, infused with conviction from his struggles against militarism and imprisonment, deeply impressed the young man. Ten days later, on August 24, Ikeda began practicing Nichiren Buddhism at age 19; Toda was 47.

In April 1948, Ikeda enrolled in night classes at Taisei Gakuin. That September, he attended Toda's Lotus Sutra lectures. Taking Toda as his mentor, he deepened his Buddhist understanding and vowed to dedicate his life to kosen-rufu. In January 1949, he began working at Toda's publishing company as a magazine editor.

**Shared Struggle and "Toda University"**

In July 1949, the Soka Gakkai launched its monthly magazine, _The Daibyakurenge_. Toda's subsequent business difficulties led him to announce his intention to resign as general director in August 1950. When Ikeda asked, "Who will be my mentor from here on?" Toda reaffirmed their bond: "Though I've caused you nothing but trouble, I am your mentor."

Ikeda resolved deeply to solve Toda's financial crisis, enabling him to lead as president. When Toda urged him to continue night school, the mentor offered instead to personally instruct him through what became known as "Toda University"—a nearly decade-long private education surpassing university-level learning.

During this intensive period, Toda shared his vision with his most trusted disciple: establishing the newspaper _Seikyo Shimbun_ for spreading Buddhism through the written word, and founding Soka University. Both materialized from mentor-disciple dialogues.

**Second President's Inauguration and Achievements**

On May 3, 1951, Toda was inaugurated as second president, declaring his vow to achieve 750,000 member households—seemingly impossible when membership was only about 3,000. Before his inauguration, he restructured the organization with a chapter-based system.

The _Seikyo Shimbun_ began publication April 20, with Toda's serialized novel _Human Revolution_ (written under the pen name Myo Goku). "Human revolution" refers to individual life transformation through Buddhism, eventually leading to universal transformation.

Toda established the women's division, young men's division, and young women's division immediately after inauguration.

In early 1952, Ikeda became chapter advisor for the Kamata Chapter in Tokyo. His February Campaign resulted in 201 new households joining that month—unprecedented and marking a turning point toward achieving the 750,000-household goal.

Toda also commissioned the publication of _Nichiren Daishonin's Complete Works_ (April 1952), recognizing it as indispensable for correct study and kosen-rufu progress. From then on, every member studied the Daishonin's writings directly.

**Political and Social Engagement**

In April 1955, the Soka Gakkai ran its first local election candidates, based on the Daishonin's principle of establishing correct teaching for national peace.

In 1956, Ikeda inspired remarkable growth throughout Kansai, with Osaka achieving 11,111 new households in May alone. In the July House of Councillors election, an Osaka candidate Ikeda had guided won unexpectedly, prompting headlines: "What was thought impossible has been achieved!"

Three Soka Gakkai-endorsed candidates were elected to the House of Councillors, making the organization increasingly influential—and attracting opposition from vested interests.

**Ikeda's Arrest and Court Battle**

When the Yubari Coal Miners Union in Hokkaido unjustly suppressed Soka Gakkai members' religious freedom in June 1957, Ikeda immediately went there to address the injustice. On July 3—the same date Toda was released from prison in 1945—Ikeda was unjustly arrested by Osaka Prefectural Police in what became known as the Osaka Incident. Election campaign members faced charges; Ikeda was baselessly accused of orchestrating illegal activities.

During harsh fifteen-day interrogation, prosecutors threatened to arrest President Toda if Ikeda didn't confess—and Toda's failing health made imprisonment potentially fatal. To protect his mentor, Ikeda confessed temporarily, resolved to prove his innocence in court.

Years later, Ikeda referenced this in a haiku: "On this day of release and of imprisonment are found the bonds of mentor and disciple."

After four-and-a-half years of court battles, on January 25, 1962, Ikeda was pronounced not guilty on all charges, with the prosecutor declining to appeal.

**Nuclear Weapons Declaration and Kosen-rufu Day**

On September 8, 1957, Toda issued his "Declaration Calling for the Abolition of Nuclear Weapons," launching the Soka Gakkai's peace movement. Based on Buddhism's principle that all life is sacred, he identified nuclear weapons as devilish creations threatening humanity's fundamental right to live.

In December 1957, the Soka Gakkai achieved its 750,000-household membership goal. In March 1958, it completed and donated the Grand Lecture Hall at Taisekiji, the Nichiren Shoshu head temple. On March 16, six thousand youth led by Ikeda gathered for a ceremony where Toda entrusted them with kosen-rufu. Toda declared: "The Soka Gakkai is the king of the religious world!"

This date, March 16, became Kosen-rufu Day, commemorating the entrustment of the mission to younger successors.

On April 2, 1958, Toda passed away at 58, having completed his mission. Based on his prison awakening, he rebuilt the Soka Gakkai and constructed an unshakeable foundation for kosen-rufu's future.

## 3. Daisaku Ikeda (Third President)

**New Leadership and Global Expansion**

After Toda's death, Ikeda served as general administrator (from June 1958) and was inaugurated as third president on May 3, 1960. In his inaugural address, he stated: "Though I am young, from this day I will take leadership as a representative of President Toda's disciples and advance with you another step toward the substantive realization of kosen-rufu."

On October 2, 1960, President Ikeda departed Japan for North and South America, beginning worldwide propagation efforts. In January 1961, he visited Hong Kong and India; that October, he traveled to Europe. These journeys opened substantive paths toward achieving the Daishonin's predicted westward transmission of Buddhism and global Mystic Law propagation.

**The Human Revolution Novels**

Under the pen name Ho Goku, Ikeda wrote the novel _The Human Revolution_, serialized in _Seikyo Shimbun_ from 1965, eventually spanning twelve volumes. Its preface conveys the main theme: "A great human revolution in just a single individual will help achieve a change in the nation's destiny and further, enable a change in all humankind's destiny." The novel chronicles the three founding presidents' efforts to build foundations for universal happiness and peace.

Ikeda subsequently authored _The New Human Revolution_, a thirty-volume novel also serialized in the newspaper, continuing the Soka Gakkai's historical chronicle.

**Movement for Peace, Culture, and Education**

Toda envisioned that as kosen-rufu advances, capable individuals emerge across society's various fields. He expected the Soka Gakkai to become an important cultural mainstay for universal peace and prosperity, requiring it to become an outstanding educational movement raising capable people.

Under Ikeda's leadership, the Soka Gakkai developed a growing peace, culture, and education movement grounded in Buddhist principles, making significant social contributions.

The organization created specialized groups for educators, scientists, academics, artists, writers, physicians, business professionals, agricultural workers, island residents, and community activists. It established institutions including the Institute of Oriental Philosophy, the Min-On Concert Association, and the Tokyo Fuji Art Museum.

In 1964, Komeito, an independent political party supporting ordinary people and society, was established with Soka Gakkai member support.

Ikeda also established educational institutions embodying the three founding presidents' value-creating pedagogy philosophy. These include Tokyo Soka Junior and Senior High Schools (1968), Soka University (1971), Kansai Soka Junior and Senior High Schools (1973), and Soka University of America (2001 in California).

**Global Dialogues and Peace Initiatives**

Ikeda broadened efforts conducting global dialogues on peace, culture, and education. On September 8, 1968, he proposed normalizing Japan-China relations. Beginning May 1972, he engaged in forty-hour dialogues with renowned British historian Arnold J. Toynbee over two years, initiating extensive exchanges with influential global leaders and thinkers.

In 1974-1975, during the Cold War and China-Soviet tensions, Ikeda visited China, the Soviet Union, and the United States, engaging top leaders in peace-building discussions.

On January 26, 1975, Soka Gakkai members representing 51 countries and territories gathered in Guam to establish the Soka Gakkai International (SGI), with Ikeda as president.

**Priesthood Issues and Honorary President**

Starting around 1977, Nichiren Shoshu priests began making unfounded accusations—the first priesthood issue. Priests and former leaders who had betrayed the Soka Gakkai formed an alliance to sever the mentor-disciple bond between Ikeda and members, aiming to control the organization.

To protect members and seek resolution, Ikeda stepped down as president in April 1979, assuming the title of honorary president.

**Ongoing Honors and Contributions**

Beginning 1983, Ikeda issues annual Peace Proposals on January 26 (SGI Day), valued globally. He has delivered over thirty university lectures and conducted more than 1,600 dialogues with world leaders, thinkers, and cultural figures, with over seventy published in book form. The Toynbee dialogue has been published in approximately thirty languages, praised as a guide for global culture and human education.

In 1995, the SGI Charter was adopted, clarifying humanist principles; in 1996, the Toda Peace Institute was founded, focusing on Josei Toda's legacy and teachings.

Streets and parks bearing the three founding presidents' names appear worldwide. Ikeda has received numerous national medals, honorary doctorates and professorships, and honorary citizenships.

**Second Priesthood Issue and New Era**

In 1991, the Nichiren Shoshu priesthood excommunicated the Soka Gakkai's millions of worldwide members—the second priesthood issue. The Soka Gakkai strictly admonished this grave slander of the Daishonin's teachings and betrayal of his intent.

Having triumphed over priesthood schemes, the Soka Gakkai has ushered in a new worldwide kosen-rufu era. Members practice Nichiren Buddhism in 192 countries and territories, earning widespread trust for contributions based on Buddhist humanism.

In November 2013, the Hall of the Great Vow for Kosen-rufu was completed in Tokyo as part of the Soka Gakkai Headquarters complex. In the entrance monument inscription, Ikeda wrote: "Kosen-rufu is the path to attaining universal peace and prosperity. It is our great vow from time without beginning for the enlightenment of all people."

Members worldwide gather at the Hall to chant before the Kosen-rufu Gohonzon, united in achieving kosen-rufu with fresh determination. Through the Soka Gakkai's efforts, Nichiren Buddhism now shines as a great source of hope globally, illuminating all humankind like the sun.
