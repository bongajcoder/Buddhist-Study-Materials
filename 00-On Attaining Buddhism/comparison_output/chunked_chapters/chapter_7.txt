Faith for Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime—

Advance Unerringly Along the Great Path



of the Oneness of Mentor and Disciple

If you chant Myoho-renge-kyo with deep faith in this principle [that the

entity of your life is in fact the entity of the Mystic Law], you are certain to

attain Buddhahood in this lifetime. That is why the sutra states, “After I have

passed into extinction, [one] should accept and uphold this sutra. Such a

person assuredly and without doubt will attain the Buddha way” [The Lotus

Sutra and Its Opening and Closing Sutras, p. 318]. Never doubt in the slightest.

Respectfully.

Maintain your faith and attain Buddhahood in this lifetime. Nam-myoho-

renge-kyo, Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.

—Nichiren (“On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime,” The Writings of Nichiren Daishonin, vol. 1, p. 4)
