If you wish to free yourself from the sufferings of birth and death you have
endured since time without beginning and to attain without fail unsurpassed
enlightenment in this lifetime, you must perceive the mystic truth that is orig-
inally inherent in all living beings. This truth is Myoho-renge-kyo. Chanting
Myoho-renge-kyo will therefore enable you to grasp the mystic truth innate
in all life. (“On Atsaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime” The Writings of Nichiren Daishonin, vol. 1, p. 3)

ust what constitutes a deeply meaningful life?

What is true happiness? Nichiren Buddhism

is a teaching of hope that enables us to forge
a state of unsurpassed and indestructible happi-
ness and to lead a life of supreme value, while
also helping others do the same.

All people have the potential to attain
Buddhahood; moreover, they can gain that lofty
state just as they are and in fact are assured
of being able to do so in this lifetime. Nichiren
Buddhism clearly elucidates this wonderful path
to enlightenment.

Nichiren Daishonin’s profound teaching of

attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime was 4
revolutionary concept that turned prevailing
Buddhist thought on its head. Indeed, it con-
tinues to shine today as a principle that can
powerfully transform the age and open a bright
future for our modern world in the twenty-first
century.

Therefore, I look forward to studying
Nichiren’s writing “On Attaining Buddhahood in
This Lifetime” together with you, as we embark in
high spirits on a new journey of growth and
development toward the Soka Gakkai’s eightieth
anniversary (in 2010).

The Profound Meaning of
Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo

“On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime” is
an important writing that clarifies the basic
theory and practice of Nichiren Buddhism. SGI
members throughout the globe have deepened
their understanding of the essence of Nichiren
Daishonin’s teachings by earnestly studying this
writing as a guideline for practice and study.

Although the original is no longer extant and
the precise date and name of the recipient are
unknown, this letter is traditionally thought to
have been written around 1255 and addressed to
Toki Jonin.' The assertion that it was composed
in 1255, shortly after Nichiren publicly declared
his teaching of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo in 1253, is
credible in view of the letter’s content, explaining
as it does the significance of chanting Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo in terms of both theory and
practice.

The practice of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-
kyo is the foundation of Nichiren’s lifetime of
teachings. Nichiren Buddhism, unlike the estab-
lished Buddhist schools of his day, was not
dedicated to the worship of a specific god or Bud-
dha. Nichiren established the means for all people
to achieve enlightenment, the ideal of the Lotus
Sutra, by formulating the practice of chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, which enables us to acti-
vate our inherent Buddha nature and manifest it
as the life-state of Buddhahood,

In Nichiren Buddhism, chanting Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo has two aspects; the chanting
of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo in terms of faith and
chanting in terms of practice, Chanting in terms
of faith refers to the spiritual aspect of our prac-
tice. This essentially consists of the struggle we
wage in our hearts against our inner delusion or

darkness—a battle against the negative and
destructive forces within us. It means that
through the power of faith—in other words,
through strengthening our conviction that we
possess the Buddha nature—we can break
through the darkness obscuring this awareness,
thus revealing the life-state of Buddhahood.
Chanting in terms of practice, meanwhile, refers
to chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo ourselves
and also teaching it to others. It means making
efforts in word and deed for our own and others’
happiness in the course of our spiritual struggle
against inner negativity and illusion.

When we chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, we
are both chanting the name of, and calling forth,
the Buddha nature in our own lives and the lives
of others. Through applying our practice of faith
to win over doubt and delusion, the power of our
inherent Buddha nature is called forth by the
sound of our chanting and spontaneously mani-
fests in our lives.*

The key point that sets Nichiren Buddhism
apart from the other Buddhist schools of his day
was the establishment of this concrete means
for attaining Buddhahood. And from the time he
first declared Nam-myoho-renge-kyo until the
moment of his death, Nichiren ardently strove to
teach this supreme path of enlightenment to peo-
ple throughout the land.

In the opening passage of “On Attaining Bud-
dhahood in This Lifetime,” Nichiren clearly and
fully articulates the basic philosophy of enlight-
enment that lies at the heart of his teaching,
which exists for the happiness of all humanity: “If
you wish to free yourself from the sufferings of
birth and death you have endured since time
without beginning and to attain without fail
unsurpassed enlightenment in this lifetime, you
must perceive the mystic truth that is originally

inherent in all living beings. This truth is Myoho-
renge-kyo. Chanting Myoho-renge-kyo will
therefore enable you to grasp the mystic truth
innate in all life” (WND-1, 3).

We'll discuss the profound meaning of this
passage in detail next time. But briefly, it says that

© ¢ e ¢ e @ o

by manifesting within us the mystic truth inher-
ent in all living beings, we can free ourselves from
the endless sufferings of birth and death. The
name of that mystic truth is Myoho-renge-kyo,
and the way to manifest it is through chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.

The Significance of Our Existence as Human Beings

Nevertheless, even though you chant and believe in Myoho-renge-kyo, if you
think the Law is outside yourself, you are embracing not the Mystic Law but

an inferior teaching. (\vD-1, 3)

he concept of attaining Buddhahood in
ik lifetime refers to ordinary people

becoming enlightened during the course
of their present existences. By extension, it means
that they can achieve this just as they are. As such,
attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime means
the same thing as attaining Buddhahood in one’s
present form, which is the Lotus Sutra’s approach
to Buddhahood and illustrated by the example
of the dragon king’s daughter’ in the sutra’s
“Devadatta” chapter.

This view contrasts sharply with the pre-
Lotus Sutra teachings, which expound that one
can become enlightened only after practicing
austerities over countless lifetimes, Because the

life-state of Buddhahood is at one with the eter-
nal Mystic Law and abounds with infinite wisdom
and compassion, it tended to be seen as some-
thing completely separate and removed from the
lives of ordinary people steeped in illusion.
Attaining enlightenment was thought to require
overcoming the unfathomably deep chasm
between the spiritual states of a Buddha and ordi-
nary people, and this gave rise to the idea that it
was necessary to carry out austere practices for
innumerable kalpas.*

Nichiren Buddhism clarifies that it is specifi-
cally in this present existence, in which we have
been born as human beings, that we can actualize
the principle of attaining Buddhahood in one’s

anaiera

present form as explained in the Lotus Sutra. And
Nichiren Daishonin reveals how to actualize this
profound teaching.

Drawing an analogy to rice crops, Nichiren
notes that while some ripen early and some ripen
late, they will all mature and be ready for harvest
within the year. He explains that votaries of the
Lotus Sutra will likewise attain Buddhahood in
this existence without fail.5

Nichiren places importance on the present
lifetime of human beings. Of course, not only
humans but also all living beings possess the
Buddha nature and have the potential to attain
Buddhahood in their present form, but Nichiren’s
focus is always first and foremost on the happi-
ness of human beings.

The human heart is sensitive, multifaceted
and rich; it has the capacity for magnificent
achievement. For that very reason, the heart often
undergoes great suffering and torment, and can
become trapped in an endless, downward spiral.

SGI President Ikeda
at Soka University,
Hachioji, Tokyo,
on May 5, 2006.

Will we transmigrate forever along the paths of
evil, or can we succeed in directing our lives into
an orbit of good?

As evidenced in many of his writings,
Nichiren repeatedly stresses the crucial impor-
tance of the heart, or mind. In this inner realm of
life, the potential resides for dramatic shifts from
evil to good or from good to evil. That is why
Nichiren’s teaching of enlightenment can be
viewed as a process that begins with inner change.
In other words, through the power of faith, we
can defeat the negative functions inside us that
are governed by the fundamental darkness in all
human hearts and manifest the positive functions
of life that are one with the Dharma nature—our
Buddhahood.

This present lifetime, in which we have been
born as human beings, represents a golden
opportunity to ensure that our lives no longer
transmigrate along the evil paths but instead
traverse the paths of good.

On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime

Emphasis on Inner Change

Therefore, when you chant myoho and recite renge, you must summon up deep
faith that Myoho-renge-kyo is your life itself. (wwp-1, 3)

CSO
Arouse deep faith, and diligently polish your mirror day and night. How
‘should you polish it? Only by chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. (WND-1, 4)

n “On Attaining Buddhahood in This Life-
a profound change in our lives, in our hearts and
minds.
of the mutually inclusive relationship of a single
moment of life and all phenomena” (WND-1, 3).
What this means is that our lives or our minds at
each moment both embody all phenomena and
pervade all phenomena. This could be described as
a life-state of oneness with the universe.

Also, Nichiren warns that if we seek the Mystic
Law outside ourselves, then no matter how much
we chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, we cannot
manifest the condition of enlightenment; on the
contrary, our Buddhist practice will only “become
an endless, painful austerity” (WND-1, 4), He
clearly states: “Even though you chant and believe
in Myoho-renge-kyo, if you think the Law is out-
side yourself, you are embracing not the Mystic
Law but an inferior teaching” (WND-1, 3).

Nichiren explains that the key to chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is summoning up deep
faith, or confidence, in the existence of our innate
Buddhahood. He declares that when we do so, we
can polish our lives and reveal our enlightenment,
writing: “Therefore, when you chant myoho and
tecite renge [that is, chant Nam-myoho-renge-
kyo], you must summon up deep faith that
Myoho-renge-kyo is your life itself (literally,
your mind at each moment]” (WND-1, 3). He
continues: “Arouse deep faith, and diligently
polish your mirror day and night. How should you
polish it? Only by chanting Nam-myoho-renge-
kyo” (WND-1, 4).

In addition, Nichiren speaks of “the mystic
entity of the Middle Way that is the ultimate
reality” (WND-1, 4)—in other words, the mystic,
inscrutable nature of life, of our hearts and
minds, that manifests as Buddhahood. Here, he
indicates that Myoho-renge-kyo is the wonderful
law of life, of the inner realm of our beings.
On that basis, he asserts that when we chant
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo with deep faith in the

Mystic Law, we can reveal our Buddhahood in this
lifetime. Nichiren writes: “The Lotus Sutra is the
king of sutras, the direct path to enlightenment, for
it explains that the entity of our life (literally, our
mind or inner reality], which manifests either good
or evil at each moment, is in fact the entity of the
Mystic Law. If you chant Myoho-renge-kyo with
deep faith in this principle, you are certain to attain
Buddhahood in this lifetime” (WND-1, 4).

A Teaching of Genuine Humanism

Next, [ll touch on the significance of Nichiren
Daishonin’s teaching of attaining Buddhahood in
this lifetime from three perspectives.

Pll start by pointing out that through opening
the way for all people to attain Buddhahood in
this lifetime through chanting Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo, Nichiren established for the first time
a teaching of genuine humanism. Opening the
way to enlightenment for all people could be
called the prerequisite for a genuinely humanistic
religion. This, I believe, is the religious or philo-
sophical significance of the principle of attaining
Buddhahood in this lifetime.

Nichiren had deep insight into the potential
of human beings, discerning that they could free
themselves from a cycle of negative transmigra-
tion and realize a positive one through profound
inner change. And he set forth a practical way to
enable all people to achieve this. Consequently,
there is no other teaching that can more
deservedly be called humanistic than Nichiren
Buddhism,

In “The True Aspect of All Phenomena,”
Nichiren writes: “Though it is thought that
Shakyamuni Buddha possesses the three virtues
of sovereign, teacher, and parent for the sake

of all of us living beings, that is not so. On the
contrary, it is common mortals who endow him
with the three virtues” (WND-1, 384). This pas-
sage describes a shift from an authoritarian to a
humanistic, people-centered religion.’ The
teaching of Nichiren, who established the con-
crete means for achieving enlightenment in this
lifetime, makes this shift possible.

When the Soka Gakkai’s first president,
Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, formulated his theory of
value, he did not include the aspects of “holiness”
or “sacredness,” which many thinkers before him
had considered to constitute religious value. For
Mr. Makiguchi, “great good” was deemed the high-
est value a religion should strive to realize. By “great
good,” he is referring to the highest value that can
be actualized by human beings and society. In
Mr. Makiguchi’s theory of value, we find the view
that a true religion is one that serves the welfare of
human beings. Nichiren’s opening of the path to
attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime signifies
the establishment of a religion that contributes
to the happiness of human beings in the greatest
possible way.

The Significance of Attaining
Buddhahood for Our Lives

Second, by opening the path to attaining Buddha-
hood in this lifetime, Nichiren Daishonin made it
possible for us to lead lives based on the infinite
power of the Mystic Law—that is, to lead solid
and secure lives that give us the courage and con-
fidence to be self-reliant. This is the significance
of the principle of attaining Buddhahood in this
lifetime in terms of our individual lives.

In Nichiren Buddhism, attaining enlightenment
is not about embarking on some inconceivably long


============================================================

============================================================

On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime

journey to become a resplendent, godlike Buddha;
it is about accomplishing a transformation in the
depths of one’s being. This revolutionary view
of enlightenment fundamentally changed the
meaning of Buddhist practice from how it was
traditionally viewed.

In other words, it is not a matter of practicing in
order to scale the highest summit of enlightenment
at some point in the distant future. Rather, it is
a constant, moment-to-moment, inner struggle
between revealing our innate Dharma nature or
allowing ourselves to be ruled by our fundamental
darkness and delusion. This unceasing effort to pol-
ish our lives is the essence of Buddhist practice.

Only by winning over our inner darkness
and negativity can we be victorious in life and
reveal our full potential. The same is true if we
wish to savor true fulfillment. Allow me to
emphasize, then, that the Nichiren Buddhist
practice toward attaining Buddhahood in this
lifetime is the only means to conquer the dark-
ness and delusion that are the fundamental
source of human evil, and cultivate true inde-
pendence. It allows us to construct a solid self,
and achieve a state of life of boundless happi-
ness and peace of mind. Attaining Buddhahood
in this lifetime thus becomes the fundamental
purpose of an individual’s life.

g Budd ida hahood for Humanity

The Lotus Sutra is the king of sutras, the direct path to enlightenment, for it
explains that the entity of our life, which manifests either good or evil at each
moment, is in fact the entity of the Mystic Law.

If you chant Myoho-renge-kyo with deep faith in this principle, you are
certain to attain Buddhahood in this lifetime. That is why the sutra states,
“After I have passed into extinction, {one] should accept and uphold this sutra.
Such a person assuredly and without doubt will attain the Buddha way.” Never

doubt in the slightest. (wxp-i, 4)

in this lifetime is significant in that it offers

a source of hope to humanity and opens the
way to transforming the destiny of all humankind.
This is its collective or universal significance.

Many leading thinkers and intellectuals recog-
nize that moder civilization has lost sight of the
human being and become deadlocked on many
fronts. There is no denying that the inner spiritual

realm has been neglected and all too many people
are obsessed with seeking comfort, ease and pleasure
in external things—things outside of themselves.
Without surmounting the fundamental human
delusions of greed, anger and foolishness, we can-
not solve the many problems that the world faces
today, including the preoccupation with economic
growth, politics that are devoid of humanism,
international conflicts, warfare, growing disparity

an


============================================================

============================================================

between rich and poor, and rampant discrimina-
tion. One conclusion from my dialogues with
leading thinkers is that the only real solution is for
human beings themselves to change, that the sole
key lies in human revolution.

It could further be said that without establish-
ing a correct view of life and death, it is
impossible to conquer inner darkness and delu-
sion at the most fundamental level. Without the
Middle Way view of life and death—a view that
rejects the extremes of the doctrine of annihila-
tion and the doctrine of eternity’—true and
lasting happiness cannot be achieved.

The only way for human beings to change is
for them to conquer their inner darkness and
rediscover the eternal dignity within their own
lives. Cultivating the noble spirit with which all
people are originally endowed will directly lead to
a change in the destiny of humankind. With that
conviction, we of the SGI have been working to
build a network of good all around the globe.

In the course of these lectures, I will comment
further on the growing expectations and praise for
this unprecedented endeavor we are undertaking.

At the end of “On Attaining Buddhahood in
This Lifetime,” Nichiren Daishonin writes: “Never
doubt in the slightest” (WND-1, 4). He is telling

LLL a

us that we should have complete confidence in
the revealing of our Buddhahood in this lifetime.
His words also contain the warning that unless we
maintain this strong confidence, or faith, we can
easily lose sight of the fundamental goal of attain-
ing Buddhahood in this lifetime and fall into the
depths of darkness and delusion.

All people at the core of their lives yearn to
attain enlightenment. But there is no teaching
more difficult to believe or understand than the
teaching that we can definitely manifest the state
of Buddhahood in our present existence. We of
the SGI have taken on the challenge of practicing
this profound teaching and sharing it widely with
others around the globe.

In today’s world, we, the courageous Bodhi-
sattvas of the Earth, are showing great actual
proof of humankind’s potential to transform
its destiny. Proud of our noble mission, let us
continue to joyously spread Nichiren Buddhism—
with its teaching of attaining Buddhahood in this
lifetime that enables all people to achieve unsur-
passed happiness—and lead the most valuable
and fulfilling lives possible.

1, Toki Jonin: A lay follower of Nichiren Daishonin. He lived in Wakamiya,
Katsushika District of Shimosa Province (part of present-day Chiba Prefec-
ture) and served as a retainer to Lord Chiba, He was the recipient of many
of Nichiren’s writings, including “The Object of Devotion for Observing
the Mind,” and carefully preserved them.

2. In “How Those Initially Aspiring to the Way Can Attain Buddhahood
through the Lotus Sutra,” Nichiren writes: “When we revere Myoho-renge-
kyo inherent in our own life as the object of devotion, the Buddha nature
within us is summoned forth and manifested by our chanting of Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo, This is what is meant by ‘Buddha.’ To illustrate, when a
caged bird sings, birds who are flying in the sky are thereby summoned
and gather around, and when the birds flying in the sky gather around, the
bird in the cage strives to get out. When with our mouths we chant the
Mystic Law, our Buddha nature, being summoned, will invariably emerge”
(WND-1, 887).

3. In “Devadatta,” the twelfth chapter of the Lotus Sutra, the ¢ight-year-old
daughter of the dragon king Sagara conceives the desire for enlightenment
when she hears Bodhisattva Manjushri preach the Lotus Sutra, She comes
to offers a jewel to Shakyamuni and instantaneously pertects the bodhi-
sattva practice. She then appears in a land to the south called Spotless
World and manifests the state of Buddhahood without changing her

dragon form and preaches the Lotus Sutra te ail living beings there (see
The Lotus Sutra and Its Opening and Closing Sutras, pp. 226-23).

4. In ancient Indian cosmology, an extremely long period of time.

. In his writing “The Doctrine of Three Thousand Realms in a Single
Moment of Life,” Nichiren states: “Lf votaries of the Lotus Sutra carry out
religious practice as the sutra directs, then every one of them without
exception will surely attain Buddhahood within his or her present lifetime.
To cite an analogy, if one plants the fields in spring and summer, then,
whether it be early or late, one is certain to reap a harvest within the year.
Votaries of the Lotus Sutra fall into three categories, superior, middling,
inferior, depending upon their capacities, and yet all will invariably attain
enlightenment within a single lifetime” (WND-2, 83).

?. The doctrine of annihilation is the mistaken attachment to the notion that
lite begins with birth and ends with death, According to this view, there is
only the present life, and death represents a complete cessation of existence
both physical and spiritual. The doctrine of eternity is also the mistaken
notion that what exists here in the present is permanent and unchanging,
This view rejects causality, so that neither practicing good nor practicing
evil produces any change in one’s condition,

On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime

Key Points

Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo

in Terms of Faith and Practice
In Nichiren Buddhism, chanting Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo has two aspects: the chanting of Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo in terms of faith and chanting in
terms of practice. Chanting in terms of faith refers
to the spiritual aspect of our practice. This essen-
tially consists of the struggle we wage in our hearts
against our inner delusion or darkness—a battle
against the negative and destructive forces within
us. It means that through the power of faith—in
other words, through strengthening our conviction
thus revealing the life-state of Buddhahood. Chant-
ing in terms of practice, meanwhile, refers to
chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo ourselves and
also teaching it to others. It means making efforts in
negativity and illusion. (p. 3)

The Heart ts Most Important

The human heart is sensitive, multifaceted and rich;
it has the capacity for magnificent achievement. For
that very reason, the heart often undergoes great
an endless, downward spiral. Will we transmigrate
forever along the paths of evil, or can we succeed in
directing our lives into an orbit of good? As evi-
denced in many of his writings, Nichiren repeatedly
stresses the crucial importance of the heart, or
for dramatic shifts from evil to good or from good
to evil. That is why Nichiren’s teaching of enlighten-
ment can be viewed as a process that begins with
inner change. In other words, through the power of
faith, we can defeat the negative functions inside us
that are governed by the fundamental darkness in all
human hearts and manifest the positive functions
of life that are one with the Dharma nature—our
Buddhahood. (p. 5)

A Humanistic,
People-centered Religion

Nichiren had deep insight into the potential of
human beings, discerning that they could free them-
selves from a cycle of negative transmigration and
realize a positive one through profound inner
change. And he set forth a practical way to enable all
people to achieve this. Consequently, there is no
other teaching that can more deservedly be called
humanistic than Nichiren Buddhism. In “The True
Aspect of All Phenomena,” Nichiren writes:
“Though it is thought that Shakyamuni Buddha
possesses the three virtues of sovereign, teacher, and
parent for the sake of all of us living beings, that is
not so. On the contrary, it is common mortals who
endow him with the three virtues” (WND-1, 384).
This passage describes a shift from an authoritarian
to a humanistic, people-centered religion. The
teaching of Nichiren, who established the concrete
means for achieving enlightenment in this lifetime,
makes this shift possible. (p. 7)

The Fundamental Purpose of Our Lives
Only by winning over our inner darkness and neg-
ativity can we be victorious in life and reveal our
full potential. The same is true if we wish to savor
true fulfillment. Allow me to emphasize, then, that
the Nichiren Buddhist practice toward attaining
Buddhahood in this lifetime is the only means to
conquer the darkness and delusion that are the
fundamental source of human evil, and cultivate
true independence. It allows us to construct a solid
self, and achieve a state of life of boundless happi-
ness and peace of mind. Attaining Buddhahood in
this lifetime thus becomes the fundamental pur-

Changing the Destiny of All Humanity
The only way for human beings to change is for
them to conquer their inner darkness and redis-
cover the eternal dignity within their own lives.
Cultivating the noble spirit with which all people
are originally endowed will directly lead to a change
in the destiny of humankind. With that conviction,
we of the SGI have been working to build a network
of good all around the globe. (p. 9)

The Significance of Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo—
Achieving a Life of Supreme Victory Through Correct Buddhist Practice

he practice of chanting Nam-myoho-
es contains immeasurable benefit,

for it enables us to summon forth in our
own lives the limitless power of the Mystic Law,
the fundamental law of the universe.

Nichiren Daishonin actualized happiness for
all humankind through the boundless beneficial
power of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. The doctrinal
basis for this endeavor is set forth with great sim-
plicity and conciseness in the opening passage of
“On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime”: “If
you wish to free yourself from the sufferings of
birth and death you have endured since time
without beginning and to attain without fail
unsurpassed enlightenment in this lifetime, you
must perceive the mystic truth that is originally
inherent in all living beings. This truth is
Myoho-renge-kyo, Chanting Myoho-renge-kyo
will therefore enable you to grasp the mystic

truth innate in all life” (The Writings of Nichiren
Daishonin, vol. 1, p. 3).

This passage encapsulates the profound prin-
ciples of Buddhism and the religious revolution
to bring about the enlightenment of all people
that was begun by Shakyamuni Buddha and com-
pleted by Nichiren. Each word and phrase is
infused with the sublime wisdom of Buddhism.

“To free oneself from the sufferings of birth
and death endured since time without beginning”
relates to the fundamental questions of human
existence and the original purpose of religion. “To
attain unsurpassed enlightenment” constitutes
the profound Buddhist response to these ques-
tions, “To perceive the mystic truth inherent in all
living beings” is this response further refined and
deepened based on the philosophy of the Lotus
Sutra. And “chanting Myoho-renge-kyo” refers to
the practice established by Nichiren to enable all

birth and death that continues from the infinite
past into the infinite future. Buddhism holds that
this never-ending round of suffering ultimately
arises from earthly desires, and that a negative
cycle of earthly desires, karma and suffering is
part and parcel of transmigration. In this sense,
“the sufferings of birth and death endured since
time without beginning” also represents an inter-
minable succession of illusion and suffering.

Because the thought of such endless transmi-
gration is ultimately unbearable, people naturally
came to wish for a way to put an end to this
painful cycle and free themselves from the chains
of delusion and suffering.

In Buddhism, there are two basic approaches to
liberation from the suffering of this cycle. One
view holds that people can free themselves from
the endless karmic cycle of birth and death by
eradicating earthly desires believed to cause it. The
other is the Mahayana approach, in which the
essence of life that undergoes transmigration is not
viewed as a transient, impermanent phenomenon.

The Mahayana teachings, for example, espouse
the concept of undergoing the cycle of birth and
death in accordance with the bodhisattva vow to
guide living beings to enlightenment; or they view
the oscillation between birth and death as a cycle
of emerging from and returning to the funda-
mental, all-embracing life of the universe. The
latter view can be easily understood using the
metaphor of waves on the ocean: birth is like a
wave appearing on the surface of the ocean—the
life of the universe—while death is the wave sub-
merging back into that ocean. Gaining such an
understanding of the essence of our own lives,
which repeat the cycle of birth and death, is to
attain “unsurpassed enlightenment,” the highest
awakening of the Buddha.

The Mystic Truth Embraces
and Is Inherent in All Things

In this passage, to “perceive the mystic truth that is
originally inherent in all living beings” means to
“attain unsurpassed enlightenment.” The wisdom
to apprehend this universally inherent truth repre-
sents the supreme enlightenment of the Buddha.

The point where Buddhism radically departs
from many other philosophies and religions is
that it uncovered within the individual’s own life
the Law, or limitless inner power, for resolving all
suffering on the most essential level. A Buddha is
one who, based on this Law, has attained the ulti-
mate wisdom to fundamentally put an end to
suffering and construct indestructible happiness.

Buddhism is a teaching of unparalleled
humanism that stresses the boundless potential
within human beings. That’s why it is called the
“internal way.”

To “perceive the mystic truth that is originally
inherent in all living beings” is to “attain unsur-
passed enlightenment”; it is the sole means for
freeing oneself from “the sufferings of birth and
death endured since time without beginning.”
This is Shakyamuni’s starting point, and the
entirety of Buddhist thought. The scripture that
proclaims this philosophy of the “internal way” is
the Lotus Sutra, which teaches that all people can
attain enlightenment. The Lotus Sutra could be
said to embody the ultimate principle of respect
for human dignity.

In this writing, Nichiren Daishonin says that
the “mystic truth that is originally inherent in all
living beings” is the “principle of the mutually
inclusive relationship of a single moment of life
and all phenomena.” This latter principle refers to
the inscrutable relationship that exists between |

ourselves—our minds or each life-moment—and
the universe; its meaning is that all phenomena
are contained in one’s life and that one’s life
pervades all phenomena. This principle no
doubt corresponds in meaning to the “principle
of inherence and pervasion™ articulated by
Nichikan, an early eighteenth-century restorer
of Nichiren Buddhism, in describing the doc-
trine of “three thousand realms in a single
moment of life”

The cosmic life enfolds and pervades every-
thing, and because it does so, it is also inherent in
all things. The oneness of the cosmic life and our
individual lives lies at the heart of the “principle
of the mutually inclusive relationship of a single
moment of life and all phenomena.” To awaken to
this mystic truth is to attain the Buddha’s “unsur-

Buddhism will not be possible if only a very
forth for apprehending the mystic truth. Before
Nichiren Daishonin, the Great Teacher T’ien-
tai of China tried to establish the means for
perceiving this mystic truth through the prac-
tice of observing the mind, also known as the
practice of concentration and insight. But it was
not a means readily accessible to the people of
the Latter Day of the Law.

The initial step Nichiren took in opening the
great path to universal enlightenment was to
name the mystic truth. The universally inherent
mystic truth originally had no name, but as
Nichiren explains in “The Entity of the Mystic
Law,’ a sage awakened to this truth in his own life

14

could give it the most appropriate name (see
WND-1, 421). Naming something is a creative
process. Giving a name that accurately grasps the
essence of a thing has the important effect of
making that essence available to all people; it
enables all people to share in its value.

In “On Attaining Buddhahood in This Life-
time,” as indicated by the passage “the mystic
truth that is originally inherent in all living beings
is Myoho-renge-kyo,” Nichiren states that this
mystic truth that constitutes the fundamental
Law of the universe is none other than Myoho-
renge-kyo. Strictly speaking, the term Myoho-
renge-kyo existed prior to this as the title of the
Lotus Sutra, but Nichiren was the first to identify
Myoho-renge-kyo as being the name of the prin-
ciple of the “true aspect of all phenomena,”
which the Lotus Sutra teaches is the profound
wisdom of all Buddhas. Also, although the “Life
Span” chapter of the Lotus Sutra expounds the
life of the eternal Buddha from the standpoint of
Shakyamuni, it was Nichiren who first revealed
that the essence of the Buddha’s eternal life—the
“heart of the ‘Life Span’ chapter’—is Myoho-
renge-kyo (see “The Object of Devotion for
Observing the Mind,” WND-1, 371).

The eternal Buddha, since attaining enlighten-
ment in the remote past, repeatedly undergoes the
cycle of birth and death as a Buddha while appear-
ing in various forms within the Ten Worlds‘ for the
salvation of all living beings. The “Life Span” chap-
ter reveals that living beings of the Ten Worlds
(including Buddhas), and the phenomena of birth
and death as well, are all manifestations of the great
eternal life of the universe. Because Nichiren says
that the “heart of the ‘Life Span’ chapter” is Myoho-
tenge-kyo, we can infer that Myoho-renge-kyo is
the name of the great, eternal, universal life that is
revealed in the “Life Span” chapter.

- Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo To Perceive the Mystic Truth
and Establish the Buddhism of the People

f

The Lotus Sutra is the king of sutras, true and correct in both word and prin-
ciple. Its words are the ultimate reality, and this reality is the Mystic Law
(myoho). It is called the Mystic Law because it reveals the principle of the
mutually inclusive relationship of a single moment of life and all phenomena.
That is why this sutra is the wisdom of all Buddhas.

Life at each moment encompasses the body and mind and the self and
environment of all sentient beings in the Ten Worlds as well as all insentient
beings in the three thousand realms, including plants, sky, earth, and even
the minutest particles of dust. Life at each moment permeates the entire realm
of phenomena and is revealed in all phenomena. To be awakened to this
principle is itself the mutually inclusive relationship of life at each moment
and all phenomena. (WwND-1, 3)

ichiren Daishonin’s next step in opening
Ne great path was to establish the prac-
tice of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.
He appended the word nam—a transliteration of

the Sanskrit word namas, meaning “devotion’—
to the universal truth of Myoho-renge-kyo, and

established the practice of invoking this truth.
Nam means “to dedicate one’s life.” Chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo aloud represents a deter-
mination and vow to dedicate one’s life to the
realm of truth of Myoho-renge-kyo in thought,
word and deed.

On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime

At the same time, chanting Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo enables each person to actualize a way
of life based on the universal truth of Myoho-
renge-kyo. The crucial point in chanting Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo in Nichiren Buddhism is not
simply intoning the name of an external truth. It
constitutes a practice to actually summon forth
the inner truth that pervades the universe and our
own selves and live our lives in accord with that
truth. This practice could be described as a

process of establishing a self capable of activating
and tapping from within the “mystic truth origi-
nally inherent in all living beings.”

Looking back on the history of Buddhism,
even though the Lotus Sutra has taught the
awakening to this mystic truth, over time people
lost sight of its existence within their own lives.
It was in that context that T’ien-t’ai established
the meditative practice for observing the mind
based on the principles of “three thousand

realms in a single moment of life” and the “mutu-
ally inclusive relationship of a single moment of
life and all phenomena.” He thereby sought to
enable people to summon forth the world of
Buddhahood. T’ien-t’ai’s meditation of observ-
ing the mind could be viewed as an appropriate
practice that restored the correct path of the
Lotus Sutra.

Further, in order to enable all people to
perceive and actualize the “mystic truth originally
inherent in all living beings,” Nichiren gave it the
name Myoho-renge-kyo and established the prac-
tice of invoking that name—the practice of
chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. By doing so, he
opened the way for all people to dedicate their
lives to and live based on the mystic truth.

Thus Nichiren established the means by
which all people can awaken to the truth of life
and the universe within their own lives and
actively manifest that truth. Moreover, this truth
is the enlightened wisdom of all Buddhas and is
revealed in the Lotus Sutra, which is the highest
teaching of Buddhism. By basing ourselves on
that truth, we can lead lives of supreme value.
Nichiren Buddhism made this realm of truth
accessible to anyone, anywhere, anytime, no mat-
ter what his or her background. It would be no
exaggeration to say that the practice of chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo in Nichiren Buddhism
gave rise to a Buddhism of the people. This prac-
tice of chanting is indeed the supreme Buddhist
practice, making it possible for us to fundamen-
tally transform our lives.

In other words, to chant Nam-myoho-renge-
kyo is to summon forth our own innate
Buddhahood:' It is the direct path to manifesting

that highest state of life. The wisdom and com-
passion of a Buddha that emerges through
chanting enriches our life-condition, and brings
happiness to ourselves and others. Further, as
more and more people come to chant Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo for the happiness of themselves
and others, it will be possible to forge an alliance
of people filled with the compassion of a Buddha
and to ultimately transform even the destiny of
humankind.

Salute to the Rise of the
Buddhism of the Sun

Another point we should bear in mind regarding
the true meaning of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is
that it is also the name of the life of the Buddha
of the Latter Day, Nichiren Daishonin. Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo and the life of the original
Buddha are indivisibly connected. We could say
that the fundamental truth of Myoho-renge-kyo
that pervades life and the universe was only iden-
tified and established for the first time through
Nichiren himself practicing it and manifesting it
in his behavior. He gave concrete expression to
the Law that people had not been able to perceive
up to that point.

Nichiren’s life as the Buddha of the Latter Day
isa life dedicated to battling evil and vanquishing
ignorance. The struggle to free people from all
misfortune and misery in the world—from all
negative karma and the sufferings of birth, aging,
sickness and death—ultimately entails battling
the fundamental darkness or ignorance that gives
rise to all evil and suffering.

On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime

As Nichiren indicates when he says that the
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo he chants for the hap-
piness of self and others toward the realization
of kosen-rufu clears “the clouds of ignorance”
(see “The Doctrine of Three Thousand Realms,”
WND-2, 85), Nam-myoho-renge-kyo truly has
the power to dispel life’s darkness. When we
chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, the sun of Bud-
dhahood rises in our hearts. The ignorance and
delusion, like heavy clouds shrouding the sun,
are swept away. When the sun of Buddhahood
comes to shine within us, the darkness of
ignorance vanishes.

But Nichiren Buddhism is not a teaching in
which Nichiren alone shines like the sun. It is a
teaching in which all of us can bring the sun of

In this regard, Nichikan writes: “When one
embraces and has faith in this Gohonzon and

chants Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, one’s life imme-
diately becomes the object of devotion of three
thousand realms in a single life-moment. It
becomes the life of Nichiren Daishonin.’® The
practice of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is
the supreme path to attaining Buddhahood
through which each person can become a shining
sun in his or her own right.

The great nineteenth-century Russian poet
Aleksandr Pushkin sings: “Before the bright
dawn, even so / Shall flicker and die every
sophistry jaded / At reason’s unperishing spark. /
Salute to the sunrise, and vanish the dark!”

Nichiren Buddhism is the Buddhism of the
sun that opens the path of life’s supreme victory
for all humankind. With “Salute to the sunrise!”
as our rallying cry, let us dynamically advance in
the struggle to dispel the darkness of ignorance in
people’s hearts.

Worlds. All phenomena, he stated, are manifestations of this universal Law:

Buddhist scriptures. From the lowest to the highest, the realms of (1) hell,

beings, (7) voice-hearers, (8) cause-awakened ones, (9) bodhisattvas and

the worlds other than Buddhas.

Key Points

Uncovering People’s Inner Potential
The point where Buddhism radically departs from
many other philosophies and religions is that it
uncovered within the individual’s own life the Law,
or limitless inner power, for resolving all suffering
on the most essential level. A Buddha is one who,
based on this Law, has attained the ultimate wis-
dom to fundamentally put an end to suffering and
construct indestructible happiness. Buddhism is a
teaching of unparalleled humanism that stresses
the boundless potential within human beings.
That’s why it is called the “internal way.” (p. 13)

The Mystic Truth of Life
and the Universe

The cosmic life enfolds and pervades everything,
and because it does so, it is also inherent in all
things. The oneness of the cosmic life and our indi-
vidual lives lies at the heart of the “principle of the
mutually inclusive relationship of a single moment
of life and all phenomena.” To awaken to this mys-
tic truth is to attain the Buddha’s “unsurpassed
enlightenment.” (p. 14)

The Meaning of Chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo
Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo enables each per-
son to actualize a way of life based on the universal
truth of Myoho-renge-kyo. The crucial point in
chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo in Nichiren
Buddhism is not simply intoning the name of an
external truth. It constitutes a practice to actually
summon forth the inner truth that pervades the
universe and our own selves and live our lives in
accord with that truth. This practice could be
described as a process of establishing a self capable
of activating and tapping from within the “mystic
truth originally inherent in all living beings.” (p. 16)

Establishing a Buddhism of the People
Nichiren established the means by which all people
can awaken to the truth of life and the universe
within their own lives and actively manifest that
truth, Moreover, this truth is the enlightened

wisdom of all Buddhas and is revealed in the Lotus
Sutra, which is the highest teaching of Buddhism.
By basing ourselves on that truth, we can lead lives
of supreme value. Nichiren Buddhism made this
realm of truth accessible to anyone, anywhere, any-
time, no matter what his or her background. It
would be no exaggeration to say that the practice
of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo in Nichiren
Buddhism gave rise to a Buddhism of the people.
This practice of chanting is indeed the supreme
Buddhist practice, making it possible for us to fun-
damentally transform our lives. (p. 17)

The Direct Path to

Manifesting Buddhahood
To chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is to summon
forth our own innate Buddhahood. It is the direct
path to manifesting that highest state of life. The
wisdom and compassion of a Buddha that emerges
through chanting enriches our life-condition, and
brings happiness to ourselves and others. Further,
as more and more people come to chant Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo for the happiness of themselves
and others, it will be possible to forge an alliance
of people filled with the compassion of a Buddha
and to ultimately transform even the destiny of
humankind. (p. 17)

Causing the Sun of
Buddhahood To Rise Within

As Nichiren indicates when he says that the Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo he chants for the happiness of self
and others toward the realization of kosen-rufu
clears “the clouds of ignorance” (see “The Doctrine
of the Three Thousand Realms,” WND-2, 85), Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo truly has the power to dispel life’s
darkness. When we chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo,
the sun of Buddhahood rises in our hearts. The igno-
rance and delusion, like heavy clouds shrouding the
sun, are swept away. When the sun of Buddhahood
comes to shine within us, the darkness of ignorance
vanishes, But Nichiren Buddhism is not a teaching
in which Nichiren alone shines like the sun. It is a
teaching in which all of us can bring the sun of
Buddhahood to rise in our lives just as he did. We are
truly fortunate in that we can manifest the same bril-
liant life-state of Buddhahood as Nichiren. (p. 18)

“lf You Think the Law Is Outside Yourself,
You Are Not Embracing the Mystic Law”

Even though you chant and believe in Myoho-renge-kyo, if you think the Law
is outside yourself, you are embracing not the Mystic Law but an inferior
teaching. “Inferior teaching” means those [Buddhist teachings] other than this
[Lotus] sutra, which are all expedient and provisional. No expedient or provi-
sional teaching leads directly to enlightenment, and without the direct path to
enlightenment you cannot attain Buddhahood, even if you practice lifetime
after lifetime for countless kalpas. Attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime is
then impossible. Therefore, when you chant myoho and recite renge,' you must
summon up deep faith that Myoho-renge-kyo is your life itself. (“On Attaining
Buddhahood in This Lifetime,” The Writings of Nichiren Daishonin, vol. 1, p. 3)

Nam-myoho-renge-kyo filled with a seeking
spirit to continually develop our faith or confi-
dence in its power. “It is the heart that is
important,” Nichiren asserts (“The Strategy of the
Lotus Sutra,” WND-1, 1000). When it comes to
chanting, therefore, we should above all strive to
summon forth the courage with which to over-
come illusion without being defeated by the
“three obstacles and four devils.””

Myoho-renge-kyo is the name of the ultimate
mystic truth, and Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is the
name of the life-state of Buddhas who embody
and reveal this truth. Thus, when we chant Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo with conviction, the infinite
benefit of Myoho-renge-kyo unfolds in our lives.
This is what it means to bring forth the world of
Buddhahood.

At work here is the principle of “cause and
effect in a single moment of life,”? in which faith
is the cause and manifesting the life-state of Bud-
dhahood is the effect. When we continue
chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo through times
of both suffering and joy while striving for our
own happiness and that of others, we can estab-
lish as the core and innermost essence of our lives
the benefit of the cause and effect for attaining
Buddhahood—which are themselves contained
within the practice of chanting. When we do so,
the indomitable state of Buddhahood emerges
within us. This is the meaning of “attaining Bud-
dhahood in this lifetime.”

In his treatise “The Object of Devotion for
Observing the Mind,” Nichiren states: “Shakya-
muni Buddha, who has attained perfect
enlightenment, is our own flesh and blood. His
practices and the resulting virtues are our bones
and marrow” (WND-1, 365). He explains that to
embrace Myoho-renge-kyo is in itself attaining

* a . ® o > s * . % ES s ° } ES Ad ,

enlightenment.’ The power of chanting Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo enables us to actualize cause
and effect in a single moment of life—that is,
faith (cause) leading to the manifestation of our
Buddhahood (effect).

Considered in this light, one’s voice chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is the voice of unshak-
able faith and seeking spirit that breaks through
the inner darkness of ignorance and illusion, and
sweeps away obstacles and devilish functions. It is
also the courageous lion’s roar that issues forth
from the Buddhahood one reveals as a result of
chanting.

The chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is
not only the voice of faith of ordinary people; it is
also the voice of Buddhahood. For that reason, we
should always try to chant resoundingly, with a
vibrant and vigorous rhythm like that of a gallop-
ing horse.

It can also be said that the chanting of Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo is an action by which we affirm
that we ourselves are inherently entities of
Myoho-renge-kyo. It represents a struggle to
return to our true, original selves and tap the
innate life force that we have possessed from time
without beginning.

Nichiren declares: “There is no true happiness
for human beings other than chanting Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo” (“Happiness in This World,”
WND-1, 681). This happiness, he says, is the
“boundless joy of the Law.”® “Joy of the Law”
describes the unshakable happiness and peace
of mind inherent in all existence. To experience
this joy means to fully savor and enjoy the infi-
nite life force that is one with the Mystic Law.
Nichiren explains that the only way for us to
taste the joy of the Mystic Law is through chant-
ing Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.

The Mystic Law and
Incomplete Teachings

Given that chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo has
such profound meaning, it is crucial to remember
when we chant that Myoho-renge-kyo is our lives
themselves. If we lose sight of this point, then no
matter how much we may chant, we will have
departed from the practice of chanting taught by
Nichiren Daishonin.

Therefore, in “On Attaining Buddhahood in
This Lifetime,” Nichiren writes in stern warning,
“Even though you chant and believe in Myoho-
renge-kyo, if you think the Law is outside yourself,
you are embracing not the Mystic Law but an infe-
that is perfect and complete; in contrast, an incom-

The above passage contains a profound phi-
losophy that overcomes one of the serious pitfalls
to which religion tends to succumb, It also
embodies a crucial philosophy of faith for attain-
ing genuine happiness.

Religion is generally held to be a universal
endeavor to connect the human being to the infi-
nite, absolute and sacred. While in a sense this may
be true, it seems that many religions postulate
from the outset a separation between the secular
and the sacred, and between human beings and
gods or Buddhas, and thus seek to bridge that gap.

Nichiren, however, regards teachings that view
the absolute or sacred as separate from human
beings as incomplete. And he cites as an example
the provisional, pre-Lotus Sutra teachings, which
do not set forth the principles or practices that
enable ordinary people to attain Buddhahood in
this lifetime. Rather, they espouse that one must
first undergo innumerable kalpas* of austere
practice before enlightenment can be achieved.

22

On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime

In the provisional, pre-Lotus Sutra teachings,
a Virtually insurmountable gulf exists between
Buddhas and ordinary people. Only a very few
exceptional practitioners who, after having
undergone austerities for countless kalpas, can
even attempt to reach the goal of enlightenment.
Moreover, according to these teachings, it is
inconceivable for someone who has become a
Buddha to go back to being an ordinary person.
As a rule, according to these teachings, the world
where Buddhas dwell is not this strife-filled saha
world where ordinary people reside. Buddhas and
ordinary people are completely separate. There-
fore, as long as that divide exists between the
world of Buddhahood and the nine worlds (the
tealm of ordinary beings), it naturally follows
that there is no way for all people to attain
enlightenment. In this worldview, ordinary peo-
ple and the idealized Buddhas are poles apart,
thus leaving ordinary people with no option but
to aspire for salvation through the assistance or
intervention of such Buddhas.

This perceived separation between the nine
worlds and the world of Buddhahood’ is demol-
ished by the Lotus Sutra doctrine of “three
thousand realms in a single moment of life’—
in other words, the teaching that “the nine
worlds have the potential for Buddhahood and
that Buddhahood retains the nine worlds”
(“The Selection of the Time,” WND-1, 539).'
Here we can see the immense importance of the
Lotus Sutra principle of the “mutual possession
of the Ten Worlds.”

Nichiren opened the way to actualizing this
latter principle, which is the key to attaining Bud-
dhahood in this lifetime, by establishing the
practice of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. This
constitutes in its fullest and most complete form
the teaching of Buddhism that seeks enlighten-
ment for all human beings.

Summoning Forth and Manifesting
the Buddha Nature

The Mystic Law is the fundamental law of the
universe. Its universality transcends our individ-
ual selves. As indicated by its description as the
“mystic truth that is originally inherent in all liv-
ing beings,” however, the Mystic Law also exists
within our lives (“On Attaining Buddhahood in
This Lifetime,” WND-1, 3). It both resides within
us and transcends us. Put another way, the Mystic
Law is inherent in our lives because it is the all-
embracing Law that pervades everything in the
universe.

In his writing “How Those Initially Aspiring
to the Way Can Attain Buddhahood through the
Lotus Sutra,” Nichiren explains the essence of
Myoho-renge-kyo as follows: “As for the meaning
of Myoho-renge-kyo: The Buddha nature inher-
ent in us, ordinary people; the Buddha nature of

SG) President Ikeda with
Brazilian Association of
Municipalities President
José do Carmo Garcia,
Tokyo, July 20, 2006.

Brahma, Shakra, and the other deities; the Bud-
dha nature of Shariputra, Maudgalyayana, and
the other voice-hearers; the Buddha nature of
Manjushri, Maitreya, and the other bodhisattvas;
and the Mystic Law that is the enlightenment of
the Buddhas of the three existences, are one and
identical. This principle is called Myoho-renge-
kyo” (WND-1, 887).

Not only is Myoho-renge-kyo our own Bud-
dha nature, he says, but it is also the Buddha
nature of all heavenly deities, voice-hearers,
bodhisattvas and so on. Moreover, this Buddha
nature is identical to the Mystic Law to which the
Buddhas of the three existences—past, present
and future—are enlightened.

Nichiren then goes on to explain that the
chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is a practice
in which we “summon forth and manifest” the
Buddha nature inherent in the lives of all beings of
the Ten Worlds: “Therefore, when once we chant

23


============================================================
PAGE 28 (Layout: single)
============================================================

Myoho-renge-kyo, with just that single sound we
summon forth and manifest the Buddha nature of
all Buddhas; all existences; all bodhisattvas; all
voice-hearers; all the deities such as Brahma,
Shakra, and King Yama; the sun and moon, and
the myriad stars; the heavenly gods and earthly
deities, on down to hell-dwellers, hungry spirits,
animals, asuras, human and heavenly beings, and
all other living beings. This blessing is immeasur-
able and boundless” (WND-1, 887).

Regarding the meaning of chanting Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo, he further states: “When we
revere Myoho-renge-kyo inherent in our own
life as the object of devotion, the Buddha nature
within us is summoned forth and manifested by
our chanting of Nam-myoho-tenge-kyo. This is
what is meant by “Buddha” (WND-1, 887). The
points to the profound significance of the
Mystic Law.

Nichiren uses a wonderful metaphor to
ing the inner Buddha nature: “When a caged bird
sings, birds who are flying in the sky are thereby
summoned and gather around, and when the
birds flying in the sky gather around, the bird in
the cage strives to get out” (WND-1, 887).

The singing of the caged bird refers to the
chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo by ordinary
people who, shackled in the chains of fundamen-
tal darkness and earthly desires, arouse faith in
the Mystic Law. In other words, it is the chanting
of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo with faith, which is
expressed as the determination to win over all
obstacles and become happy without fail through
the power of the Mystic Law.

The power of such strong, determined chant-
ing calls forth the Buddha nature in all living
beings. Not only does the Buddha nature of
Brahma and Shakra and of the Buddhas and

24

On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime

bodhisattvas throughout the universe manifest,
but those chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo can
also sever the chains of fundamental darkness
and illusion, and reveal their own Buddha nature.
In other words, it is the power of our voices
chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo that connects
our lives with the Mystic Law pervading all phe-
nomena of the three thousand realms.’

In “Letter to Niike,” Nichiren further explains
the significance of chanting through the analogy
of a mother bird and an egg." He says that the
chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is “like the
warmth of the mother bird” (WND-1, 1030). At
first there is nothing inside the egg but liquid, but
as a result of being warmed by the mother bird,
the beak, eyes and feathers are formed. Eventually,
the baby bird breaks through the shell and hatches,
and is soon flying into the sky like its mother. In
this analogy, the substance within the egg repre-
sents the Buddha nature of living beings, while
the mother bird represents the Buddha who leads
others to enlightenment. The chanting of Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo is at once the voice of faith of
ordinary people and a function of the life-state of
Buddhahood.

Nichiren’s most important admonition in
regard to attaining enlightenment through chant-
ing Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is that we must not
view the Law as something outside ourselves. If
we think the Law exists externally, then we are
reverting to the kind of divide between Buddhas
and ordinary people found in the pre-Lotus Sutra
teachings.

Perceiving That One’s Own Life
Is Nam-myoho-renge-kyo

The chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo has
immeasurable beneficial power. Josei Toda, the

second Soka Gakkai president, described the infi-
nite power of the Mystic Law as follows: “It is like
lying sprawled on your back in a wide-open space
looking up at the sky, All that you wish for imme-
diately appears. No matter how much you may
give away, there is always more. It is never
exhausted. Try and see if you can attain this state
of life.”

Indeed, Nam-myoho-renge-kyo can be likened
to a “wish-granting jewel.” How can we develop the
boundless state of life that enables us to bring forth
whatever strength is necessary? President Toda
often used to say, “If you really want to achieve such
a state of life, you have to fight with every ounce of
your being for the Lotus Sutra, for kosen-rufu!”

Such was the vast and untrammeled spirit of
my mentor: the spirit to strive forever together
with the Buddhas of the three existences and with
the life-affirming functions of the universe such
as Brahma and Shakra, wherever in the universe
we might find ourselves; the spirit to actualize a
world of happiness and peace dedicated to value
creation, by helping people overcome misery and
misfortune and the sufferings of birth, aging,
sickness and death.

Throughout everything, Mr. Toda steadfastly
continued to seek the Law that exists nowhere
but within our own lives. And he stressed the
importance of living true to oneself. His starting
point was his profound realization in prison that
the Buddha is life itself and his awakening to his
identity as a Bodhisattva of the Earth.

He also often spoke of the spirit of faith
we need in order to perceive the Mystic Law with-
in us, saying: “You have to be resolved that
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is your own life!” or
“Propagating the Mystic Law in the Latter Day

means firmly believing that your life is nothing
apart from Nam-myoho-renge-kyo!” This is the
spirit Nichiren teaches in the passage, “When you
chant myoho and recite renge, you must summon
up deep faith that Myoho-renge-kyo is your life
itself” (“On Attaining Buddhahood in This Life-
time,” WND-1, 3).

A Universal Religion for the
Happiness of All Humankind

Generally speaking, religions expound some infi-
nite and eternal entity that transcends both human
beings and the impermanence of this world, using
such terms as God or law. Different religions regard
this infinite and eternal entity variously as a source
of fear and awe, an object of adoration, a great void
of emptiness or a wellspring of all-embracing love.

Nichiren Daishonin saw the power of the
Mystic Law that encompasses and sustains all
things in the universe as existing within human
beings, and he established a means for actually
manifesting that Law in their lives.

During my second lecture at Harvard Univer-
sity (in September 1993), | proposed three areas
where Mahayana Buddhism could contribute to
modern civilization: (1) in fostering the creation
of peace; (2) in paving the way toward the restora-
tion and rejuvenation of humanity; and (3) in
providing a philosophical basis for the symbiotic
coexistence of all things. In connection with the
second point, I stressed the important significance
of the approach of Nichiren Buddhism, which
teaches neither an exclusive reliance on the “power
of self” nor on the “power of other.” This perspec-
tive has resonated deeply with many scholars.

25



============================================================
PAGE 30 (Layout: single)
============================================================

Only by communing and fusing with the
power of other—which is eternal and transcends
our limited, finite selves—can we wholly activate
the power of self. At the same time, however, this
eternal, all-encompassing power of other actually
exists inherently in our lives. Nichiren writes:
“People are certainly selfempowered, and yet
they are not selfempowered . . . People are cer-
tainly other-empowered, and yet they are not
other-empowered” (“The Meaning of the Sacred
Teachings of the Buddha's Lifetime,” WND-2,
62)." What this means, I believe, is that by relying

neither exclusively on the power of other nor on
the power of self, we can manifest the power that
exists within us yet transcends our selves. Chant-
ing Nam-myoho-renge-kyo enables us to do this.
In this way, Nichiren Buddhism opens up a
broad new vision of a universal religion for the
happiness of all humankind—one that tran-
scends the approach of teachings that strictly
divide external power and the individual’s own
power and that emphasize one over the other.

system established by T’ien-t’ai. The “three thousand realms” indi-

Each of these worlds possesses the potential for all ten within itself,
thus making one hundred possible worlds. Each of these hundred
worlds possesses the ten factors and operates within each of the
three realms of existence, thus making three thousand realms.

ignorance, which are pitiful things, but when nurtured by the

the mother bird, we develop the beak of the thirty-two features

Key Points

The Meaning of Chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo

To chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is to commune
with the Mystic Law. It is a Buddhist practice for
fusing our lives with this Law. At the same time, it
is a battle to conquer the inner darkness that pre-
vents this fusion from taking place. When, through
our practice of faith, we vanquish this darkness of
illusion and ignorance and become one with the
Mystic Law, its infinite power unfolds in our lives.
Such is the immeasurable benefit of chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. (p. 20)

The Cause and Effect of

Attaining Buddhahood
The power of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo
enables us to actualize cause and effect in a single
moment of life—that is, faith (cause) leading to
the manifestation of our Buddhahood (effect).
Considered in this light, one’s voice chanting
Nam-myoho- renge-kyo is the voice of unshakable
faith and seeking spirit that breaks through the
inner darkness of ignorance and illusion, and
sweeps away obstacles and devilish functions. It is
also the courageous lion’s roar that issues forth
from the Buddhahood one reveals as a result of
chanting. (p. 21)

Chanting Like a Galloping Horse

The chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is not
only the voice of faith of ordinary people; it is also
the voice of Buddhahood. For that reason, we
should always try to chant resoundingly, with a
vibrant and vigorous rhythm like that of a gallop-
ing horse. It can also be said that the chanting
of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is an action by which
we affirm that we ourselves are inherently entities
of Myoho-renge-kyo, It represents a struggle to
return to our true, original selves and tap the
innate life force that we have possessed from time
without beginning, (p, 21)

Bridging the Cap Between
Buddhas and Ordinary People

This perceived separation between the nine worlds
and the world of Buddhahood is demolished by
the Lotus Sutra doctrine of “three thousand realms
in a single moment of life’—in other words, the
teaching that “the nine worlds have the potential
for Buddhahood and that Buddhahood retains the
nine worlds” (“The Selection of the Time,’ WND-1,
539). Here we can see the immense importance of
the Lotus Sutra principle of the “mutual possession
of the Ten Worlds.” Nichiren opened the way to
actualizing this latter principle, which is the key to
attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime, by estab-
lishing the practice of chanting Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo. This constitutes in its fullest and most
complete form the teaching of Buddhism that
seeks enlightenment for all human beings. (p. 22)

Manifesting Our Inner Power
That Transcends Us

The Mystic Law is the fundamental law of the uni-
verse. Its universality transcends our individual
selves. As indicated by its description as the “mystic
truth that is originally inherent in all living beings,”
however, the Mystic Law also exists within our lives
(“On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime,”
WND-1, 3). It both resides within us and transcends
us. Put another way, the Mystic Law is inherent in
our lives because it is the all-embracing Law that
pervades everything in the universe. (p. 23)

Nam-myoho-renge-kyo
ls Your Own Life!

[Mr. Toda] also often spoke of the spirit of faith we
need in order to perceive the Mystic Law within us,
saying: “You have to be resolved that Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo is your own life!” or “Propagating the
Mystic Law in the Latter Day means firmly believing
that your life is nothing apart from Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo!” This is the spirit Nichiren teaches in the
passage, “When you chant myoho and recite renge,
you must summon up deep faith that Myoho-renge-
kyo is your life itself (“On Attaining Buddhahood in
This Lifetime,” WND-1, 3). (p. 25)

Transforming Our Fundamental Attitude—
Refusing To Live an “Endless, Painful Austerity”

> 2» 2) eee © © © © © © © © © &@ |
Pg a gg gg gg ag 0 os 0 On
You must never think that any of the eighty thousand sacred teachings of
Shakyamuni Buddha's lifetime or any of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas of the
ten directions and three existences are outside yourself. Your practice of the
Buddhist teachings will not relieve you of the sufferings of birth and death in
the least unless you perceive the true nature of your life, If you seek enlighten-
ment outside yourself, then your performing even ten thousand practices and
ten thousand good deeds will be in vain. It is like the case of a poor man who
spends night and day counting his neighbor's wealth but gains not even half a
coin. That is why the T’ien-t'ai school’s commentary states, “Unless one per-
ceives the nature of one’s life, one cannot eradicate one’s grave offenses.”! This
passage implies that, unless one perceives the nature of one’s life, one’s prac-
tice will become an endless, painful austerity. Therefore, such students of
Buddhism are condemned as non-Buddhist. [T’ien-t’ai’s] Great Concentration
and Insight states that, although they study Buddhism, their views are no dif-
ferent from those of non-Buddhists.

Whether you chant the Buddha’s name; recite the sutra, or merely offer
flowers and incense, all your virtuous acts will implant benefits and roots of
goodness in your life, With this conviction, you should strive in faith. (On
Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime,” The Writings of Nichiren Daishonin, vol. 1, pp. 3-4)

============================================================

he character myo of myoho, or “Mystic
[ue has three meanings: to be fully
endowed, to open and to revive.’ These
three meanings are all implicit in chanting Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo. In other words, the chanting
of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo contains (1) the myo
of perfect endowment—meaning that the single
Law of Myoho-renge-kyo encompasses all phe-
nomena; (2) the myo of transformation that
“opens” the world of Buddhahood in the lives of
beings in the nine worlds (the worlds from hell
through bodhisattva); and (3) the myo of great
benefit, whereby a life filled with suffering is
“revived” as a life of great tranquillity and joy.
Our lives themselves are entities of the Mystic
Law. Therefore, they are fully endowed with all
phenomena. Fundamental darkness and the
enlightened Dharma nature,‘ earthly desires and
enlightenment, and the nine worlds and the world
of Buddhahood—all of these exist within us. For
precisely that reason, we can carry out a mystic
and fundamental inner “revolution”—changing
darkness into light; kindling the flame of enlight-
enment by “burning the firewood of earthly
desires” (The Record of the Orally Transmitted
Teachings, p. 11) and thereby manifesting the world
of Buddhahood in our lives of the nine worlds.
The key to achieving this profound inner
transformation is our hearts—our fundamental
attitude or mind-set. Therefore, Nichiren Dai-
shonin warns in “On Attaining Buddhahood in
This Lifetime”: “If you think the Law is outside
yourself, you are embracing not the Mystic Law
but an inferior teaching” (WND-1, 3). When we
diligently exert ourselves in chanting Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo based on this admonition,
always remembering that a change in our own
hearts or minds is crucial, the three meanings of
myo will clearly manifest themselves in our lives.

Needless to say, the Law contained in the prac-
tice of chanting spread by Nichiren is truly
wondrous. But even the power of this wondrous
Law cannot fully manifest in a life clouded by
ignorance. Ignorance is the inner darkness that
prevents us from believing in the Mystic Law and
staying focused on our own Buddha nature and
that of others. The practice of chanting enables us
to break through this darkness and vibrantly
bring forth our Buddhahood. Battling our funda-
mental darkness—this inner struggle is the
essence of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.

Studying Buddhism Yet Succumbing
to Non-Buddhist Thinking

In the passage we are studying this time, Nichiren
Daishonin strongly cautions: “You must never
think that any of the eighty thousand sacred
teachings of Shakyamuni Buddha's lifetime or any
of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas of the ten direc-
tions and three existences are outside yourself”
(WND-1, 3). The use of the word never here is
deeply significant. This passage explains that the
entirety of Buddhism is contained within our own
lives. Nichiren concludes that “the eighty thou-
sand sacred teachings of Shakyamuni Buddha's
lifetime” and “the Buddhas and bodhisattvas of
the ten directions and three existences”® are all
phenomena inherent within us.

Nichiren goes on to say that as long as we seek
enlightenment outside ourselves, even our per-
forming “ten thousand practices and ten
thousand good deeds” (meaning all of the prac-
tices expounded in Shakyamuni’s lifetime
teachings) and believing in the protection of the
Buddhas and bodhisattvas throughout the three
existences (meaning the benevolent functions of

less as counting a neighbor's wealth, he states,
because we personally gain nothing from doing =
Nichiren then cites a passage from a T'ien-t al
school commentary, which states, “Unless one per-
ceives the nature of one’s life, one cannot eradicate
one’s grave offenses” (WND-1, 3-4). If we fail to
grasp this point, Nichiren warns, all of the practices
and good deeds we might perform while seeking
enlightenment outside ourselves will ultimately
become “an endless, painful austerity” (WND-1, 4).
What does it mean to say that unless we per-
ceive the nature of our lives, we cannot eradicate
our grave offenses? “Grave offenses” here can be
taken to indicate fundamental darkness, which is
the source of all evil. The grave offense of slan-
der—denigrating the Law or the correct teaching
In T'ien-t’ai’s Buddhism, it is only possible to

essence of the practice of chanting Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo.
us, we are not pursuing the path of “observing
one’s mind,” which enables us to overcome the
fundamental evil of ignorance or darkness. In
that case, all our efforts and good deeds to attain
enlightenment will be lacking the vital ingredient;
they will be every bit as futile as counting a neigh-
bor’s vast riches. Moreover, because none of these
efforts will help us eradicate our ignorance, they
will only become “an endless, painful austerity.”
This battle against ignorance is the heart of
Buddhism. It is said that Shakyamuni’s enlighten-
ment lay in identifying darkness or ignorance as

the fundamental cause of the sufferings of birth,
aging, sickness and death—as well as in expound.
ing the way for overcoming this ignorance,
Therefore, as long as we seek the path to
enlightenment outside our own lives, whatever
practices and good deeds we carry out will deviate
from the true essence of Buddhism. Accordingly,
Nichiren says: “Such students of Buddhism are
condemned as non-Buddhist” (WND-1, 4).

To Seek Enlightenment Outside
Our Lives Is To Be Defeated by
Fundamental Darkness

An important point in this writing is that we as
Nichiren Buddhists also run the risk of falling
into non-Buddhist ways of thinking if we seek the
Law outside of our own lives. Hence, as Nichiren
Daishonin’s disciples, we must always bear in
mind his admonition “You must never think that
any of the [Buddha’s] teachings . . . are outside
yourself” (WND-1, 3).

The chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is a
practice for revealing the “originally inherent
mystic truth” that exists in all people and achiev-
ing Buddhahood in this lifetime. It is an
incomparably “wonderful practice” (OTT, 88), in
the sense that it represents the means by which all
living beings can gain enlightenment.

If, however, we forget Nichiren’s admonition to
never seek the Law outside of us, then no matter
how hard we practice, we will lose sight of the cor-
tect path to universal enlightenment and effectively
wind up practicing a non-Buddhist teaching. That’s
why Nichiren is so strict on this point.

The essence of our practice is to perceive the
true nature of our lives. To do this we must wage
an inner struggle. If we allow ourselves to be
defeated by the three obstacles and four devils,*
we cannot bring forth our enlightenment. That js

why battling the darkness or ignorance within us
is an unavoidable part of the process of becoming
a Buddha. In other words, whether we continu-
ously battle our innate ignorance is the single
most important determinant in whether we
attain Buddhahood. As such, it is something we
must never forget.

By engaging in this struggle, we can reveal the
Buddha wisdom within our lives and thereby
confront and overcome our ignorance. But if we
fail to undertake this struggle, ignorance will
shroud and conceal our Buddha nature. Igno-
rance deepens and exacerbates the five delusive
inclinations of greed, anger, foolishness, arro-
gance and doubt within us. That is what happens
if we succumb to the erroneous view that the Law
is outside ourselves.

Faith for Attaining
Buddhahood in This Lifetime

Naturally, the Gohonzon—the object of devotion
in Nichiren Buddhism—in itself is great beyond
measure. A passage from Nichikan’s Six-Volume
Writings? that states: “Even someone who has not
yet aroused true faith will still receive immense
benefit through connecting with the correct
object [of devotion, namely, the Gohonzon]”
(Rokkansho, p. 81).

The true lineage of faith we inherit in the Soka
Gakkai is what opens up this infinite and bound-
less power of the Gohonzon. Faith as practiced by
the Soka Gakkai entails an active struggle to man-
ifest the Mystic Law in our lives; it also produces
clear actual proof of benefit. When we advance
together with the Soka Gakkai, we naturally come

to internalize the correct practice of faith as
taught by Nichiren Daishonin.

Therefore, those who sincerely chant Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo to the Gohonzon and practice
and participate in activities with the Soka Gakkai
cannot fail to become Buddhas. The purpose of
faith is to freely realize our full potential and shine
in our own unique way. That’s why it’s important
to keep advancing and challenging ourselves, to
have the spirit “I will exert myself in my practice! I
will deepen my faith! I will do my best as a mem-
ber of the Soka Gakkai.” This is the certain path to
attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime.

With this understanding, let’s concretely and
strictly apply to our daily practice Nichiren’s
admonition “If you think the Law is outside your-
self, you are embracing not the Mystic Law but an
inferior teaching” (WND-1, 3). To seek the Mystic
Law somewhere outside of us essentially amounts
to evading responsibility for our own lives.

Practicing Nichiren Buddhism means not
being swayed this way and that; it means con-
structing a self that is solid and resolute like
towering Mount Fuji. But if we neglect this task
and focus our energies somewhere else, before
we're even aware of it, we can end up veering onto
the path of externally seeking the Law.

For example, if we chant to the Gohonzon but
always blame other people or our environment
for our circumstances, we are avoiding the chal-
lenge of tackling our inner darkness or ignorance.
By doing so, we are seeking enlightenment out-
side of us. By changing ourselves on a more
profound level, we can begin to improve our situ-
ation. Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is the
driving force for that change.

It is also important that we don’t fall into the

On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime

trap of practicing “dependent faith,” where we pin
our hopes on having our prayers answered
through the divine or transcendent powers of
gods or Buddhas. This is a typical example of
viewing the Law as outside oneself. The provi-
sional Buddhas of the pre-Lotus Sutra teachings”
readily lend themselves to this kind of faith, the
essence of which is escapism.

Even when they’re obviously suffering, people
of dependent faith avoid looking at their prob-
lems. They don’t have the courage or make any
actual effort to challenge their situation. In such
cases, quite frankly, faith is simply something peo-
ple hide behind as they avoid dealing with reality,
Without a struggle, however, we cannot directly
engage the gears of our human revolution.

To use the analogy of mountain climbing, if we
never actually attempt to ascend its slopes, we'll
never reach the summit, no matter how much time

Passes. If we avoid challenging our own issues, we
can never strengthen and develop ourselves, and
we won't be able to attain Buddhahood in this
lifetime.

In addition, it is important that we ty to rid
our lives of ambiguous, elusive doubt and disbe-
lief as well as grumbling and complaining. The
erroneous belief that Myoho-renge-kyo (the Mys-

says, “You must summon up deep faith” (WND.),

confident and concrete prayer.

Because our practice of faith is aimed at
attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime, it is essen-
tial that we have a solidly focused attitude when
chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. It is like trying
to shoot an arrow: without a clear target, we won't
draw the bow with any real force or determina-
tion. In the same way, when we replace vague
yearnings with concrete determinations and con-
fident prayer, we can definitely accomplish what
we hope to achieve.

Grumbling and complaining are the principal
gateways to ambiguous, elusive doubt and disbe-
lief Even if we know it is wrong, we may find
ourselves grumbling and complaining in spite of
ourselves. Should such behavior become habitual,
it will act as a constant brake on our growth and
cause us to forget about advancing and improv-

own potential, falling into the path of seeking the
Law outside of us. While it might be a real chal-
lenge to stop grumbling and complaining, we can
derive from the Mystic Law the wisdom to control
these tendencies and use them as a springboard
for positive growth and development,

Let's also strictly guard against slandering our
fellow members, Slandering and harboring resent-
ment and jealousy toward others results in denying
their Buddha nature, The inability to believe in

ourselves and others. Not to believe in the Buddha
nature is to deny the spirit of the Lotus Sutra,
which teaches that all people have the potential for
Buddhahood. Consequently, Nichiren sternly
warns that if we go against the spirit of the sutra,
not only won’t we accomplish our desire to attain
Buddhahood in this lifetime, but we will end up
committing slander of the Law."

Also, unless we practice together united in the
spirit of “many in body, one in mind,” the great
desire for kosen-rufu cannot be fulfilled.”

Let us confirm once again that chanting Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo for the happiness of ourselves
and others is the true means for attaining Bud-
dhahood in this lifetime. Each person has the
potential to become a Buddha.

The Spirit of the First Three Presidents
Pulses in the Soka Gakkai

A Buddhist teaching that affirms the existence of
the Law in each person's life is one that treasures
the individual. It calls out to each person, encour-
ages his or her individual human revolution and
seeks to lead all people to enlightenment. In the
appearance of one person after another embracing
faith, we find the principle of bodhisattvas steadily
emerging from the earth to propagate the Law, and
the unchanging formula of kosen-rufu.”

This is the path of the Soka Gakkai that the first
three presidents—Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, Josei
Toda and myself—have steadfastly followed.
That is why the Soka Gakkai has achieved such phe-
nomenal development and why our kosen-rufu
movement has spread throughout the entire world.

In contrast, Buddhist teachings that view the
Law as existing outside one’s own life tend to be
authoritarian or formalistic, to disregard and
repress people. They are prone to emphasizing rit-
uals or clerical authority, while their followers
passively seek to assuage their anxieties through
dependence on ceremonies or clergy. Further, tak-
ing advantage of the fact that one of human beings’
greatest sources of anxiety is death and what comes
after, Buddhist schools of this kind in Japan have
come to function almost exclusively as purveyors
of funeral and memorial services for the deceased,
devolving into what is known as “funeral Bud-
dhism.” They offer no philosophy that empowers
people or enables them to live better lives.

The Soka Gakkai’s founder, President
Makiguchi, asserted that Nichiren Buddhism is a
“teaching for transforming one’s life.” To believe
that the Mystic Law of Myoho-renge-kyo exists
within us is to have the confidence that we will
definitely become happy and attain Buddhahood
in this lifetime. Faith also means actively working
for kosen-rufu through sharing Nichiren Bud-
dhism based on the conviction that it holds the
key to happiness for both ourselves and others.
This genuine faith pervades the Soka Gakkai and
the SGI. The greatness of the Soka Gakkai and the
first three presidents’ spirit of the oneness of
mentor and disciple shine in the undertaking this
most difficult of challenges—that of awakening
people to the Law within.

President Toda used to say, “You should
resolve, ‘I am Myoho-renge-kyo!” The Mystic
Law is the “highly effective medicine” (The Lotus
Sutra and Its Opening and Closing Sutras, p. 269)

. Asused here, “the Buddha's name” denotes Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.

Three meanings of myo: In “The Daimoku of the Lotus Sutra,”
Nichiren Daishonin writes: “Myo means to be fully endowed,
which in turn has the meaning of ‘perfect and full’ (WND-1, 146);
The character myo means to open” (WND-I, 145); and “Myo
means to revive, that is, to return to life” (WND-1, 149).

. The unchanging nature inherent in all things and phenomena.
. The ten directions refers to the entire universe, all physical space.

Specifically, the ten directions are the eight directions of the com-
pass—north, south, east, west, northwest, northeast, southeast and
southwest—plus up and down. Buddhist scriptures refer to the
existence of Buddha lands in all directions throughout the uni-
verse, each with its own Buddha. The expression the Buddhas of the
ten directions in the sutras indicates these Buddhas. The phrase ten
directions often appears with the phrase three existences, meaning
Past, present and future existences. “The Buddhas of the ten direc-
tions and three existences” thus means all Buddhas throughout
space and time.

. Substituting faith for wisdom: The principle that faith is the true

cause for gaining supreme wisdom, and faith alone leads to
enlightenment.

. Originally inherent mystic truth: The fundamental Law, Mystic

Law or Buddha nature with which all life is originally endowed.

. Various obstacles and hindrances to the practice of Buddhism that

appear as a result of one advancing correctly along the path of faith.

. Nichikan was the twenty-sixth chief priest of Taiseki-ji, the head

temple of the Nikko school (also known as the Fuji school). He is
revered as the restorer of Nichiren’s teachings because he worked to
clarify their true meaning, During the four centuries after Nichiren
Daishonin’s death, a number of errors and misconceptions had

arisen as his followers split into many schools. Nichikan worked
tirelessly to clarify the true meaning of Nichiren’s teachings. He
completed exegeses on Nichiren’s five major writings and other
works, and authored The Six- Volume Writings, which distinguishes
the correct interpretations of Nichiren’s teachings from misleading
ones.

10. The provisional teachings that preceded the Lotus Sutra do not
teach that the world of Buddhahood exists in all people, and
instead describe Buddhas as idealized and superior beings. The
Pure Land (Nembutsu) teachings, for example, explain that instead
of relying on one’s own efforts, one should exclusively depend on
salvation through such a Buddha—namely, Amida.

11. In “The Fourteen Slanders,” Nichiren writes: “There is a difference
if one chants the daimoku while acting against the intent of this
sutra ... Always remember that believers in the Lotus Sutra should
absolutely be the last to abuse one another. All those who keep faith
in the Lotus Sutra are most certainly Buddhas, and one who slan-
ders a Buddha commits a grave offense” (WND- I, 756).

12. In “The Heritage of the Ultimate Law of Life.” Nichiren writes: “All
disciples and lay supporters of Nichiren should chant Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo with the spirit of many in body but one in mind,
transcending all differences among themselves to become as insep-
arable as fish and the water in which they swim. This spiritual
bond is the basis for the universal transmission of the ultimate Law
of life and death. Herein lies the true goal of Nichiren’s propaga-
tion. When you are so united, even the great desire for widespread
propagation can be fulfilled” (WND-1I, 217).

13. In “The True Aspect of All Phenomena,” Nichiren writes: “At first
only Nichiren chanted Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, but then two,
three, and a hundred followed, chanting and teaching others. Prop-
agation will unfold this way in the future as well. Does this not
signify ‘emerging from the earth?” (WND-1, 385).

On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime

i Key Points:

The Essence of Chanting

Nam-myoho-renge-kyo
The Law contained in the practice of chanting
spread by Nichiren is truly wondrous. But even the
Power of this wondrous Law cannot fully manifest
in a life douded by ignorance. Ignorance is the
inner darkness that prevents us from believing in
the Mystic Law and Staying focused on our own
Buddha nature and that of others. The practice of
chanting enables us to break through this darkness
and vibrantly bring forth our Buddhahood. Bat-
tling our fundamental darkness—this inner
struggle is the essence of chanting Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo. (p. 29)

The Heart of Buddhism

If we seck enlightenment outside of us, We are not
pursuing the path of “observing one’s mind”
which enables us to overcome the fundamental evil
‘of ignorance or darkness, In that case, all our
efforts and good deeds to attain enlightenment will
be lacking the vital ingredient; they will be every
bit as futile as counting a neighbor's vast riches.
Moreover, because none of these efforts will help
us eradicate our ignorance, they will only become
van endless, painfull austerity” This battle against
ignorance is the heart of Buddhism. (p. 30)

The Driving Force for

Our Transformation
If we chant to the Gohonzon but always blame
other people or our environment for our circum-
stances, we are avoiding the challenge of tackling
our inner darkness or ignorance, By doing so, we
are seeking enlightenment outside of us, By chang-
ing ourselves on a more profound level that we
can begin to improve our situation. Chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is the driving force for that
change. (p, 31)

36

Confident and Concrete Prayer

The erroneous belief that Myoho-renge-kyo (the
Mystic Law) exists outside of our lives has at 1ts
core an inability to believe that all people—ou'
selves and others—possess the Buddha nature.
And this disbelief stems from fundamental dark-
ness. In terms of attitude in faith, this tendency t©
skeptically regard the Buddha nature as “a pice
ideal but one that doesn’t really change reality” will
manifest itself as prayer that is vague and lacking !"
conviction. If our efforts in faith are halfhearted,
we cannot change our attitude or fundamentally
transform our lives. As Nichiren indicates in this
writing when he says, “You must summon up deeP
faith” (WND-1, 3), if we hope to make our inher-
ent Buddha nature the basis of our lives—OT .
Nichiren terms it, to attain Buddhahood in this
lifetime—we must continue striving to deepen our
faith, our conviction in chanting Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo. And as our faith deepens, it will
manifest as confident and concrete prayer. (p. 43)

Overcoming Grumbling
and Complaining

Grumbling and complaining are the principal
gateways to ambiguous, elusive doubt and disbe-
lief. Even if we know it is wrong, we may find
ourselves grumbling and complaining in spite of
ourselves. Should such behavior become habitual,
it will act as a constant brake on our growth and
Cause us to forget about advancing and improving
ourselves. We will then effectively close off our own
potential, falling into the path of seeking the Law
outside of us, While it might be a real challenge to
stop grumbling and complaining, we can derive
from the Mystic Law the wisdom to control these
tendencies and use them as a springboard for pos-
itive growth and development. (p. 32)

Pete ec ae and, on a spiritual

overcome the ignorance or darkness that is the

Here, Nichiren uses an analogy to describe
this fundamental potential for change, saying,
“This is similar to a tarnished mirror that will
shine like a jewel when polished” (WND-1I, 4)-
In this way, he conveys that the practice of
chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo—the means
for defeating our inner darkness—serves to
“polish” our lives.

All living beings are inherently entities of the
Mystic Law. And inherently, the life-state of Bud-
dhahood enables us to tap the limitless power of
the Mystic Law within us freely and without hin-
drance, whenever and in whatever form it is
needed. Nichiren likens this supreme state of life
to a clear mirror that shines like a jewel. Yet even
though we are an entity of the Mystic Law, we
cannot bring forth the power of that Law if our
lives are shrouded in ignorance-
benighted state, we are like a “tarnished mirror”
that will not reflect anything. Chanting Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo is the practice for polishing

reality. Arouse deep faith, and diligently polish
your mirror day and night. How should you
polish it? Only by chanting Nam-myoho-renge-
kyo” (WND-1, 4).

The mirror simile here is truly ingenious.
The mirror being endowed with the property
of reflection corresponds to our lives being
endowed with the mystic truth. But if a mirror is
not polished, it will naturally become clouded.
Since mirrors in Nichiren’s day were typically
made of bronze, they would readily tarnish. A
tarnished mirror could not fulfill its original
function, so it had to be polished regularly.
Similarly, if our lives are neglected and left
uncultivated, they will be shrouded in ignorance.

The act of polishing is indispensable for
restoring the mirror’s innate property. More-
over, just polishing a mirror once is not
enough. We have to keep polishing it if we wish
it to retain its reflective property. As this
metaphor aptly attests, our practice of chanting

40

Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is a struggle to polish
our lives, thereby wiping away the dust of
ignorance and heightening the brilliance of our
enlightened Dharma nature.

This practice of polishing our lives may be
seen as having two aspects. One is to “arouse
deep faith,” as Nichiren exhorts (WND-1, 4).
This could also be articulated as summoning
the fighting spirit to battle our inner darkness.
The other aspect is to continue making stead-
fast efforts, in accord with Nichiren’s
admonition that we should “diligently polish
our mirror day and night” (see WND-1, 4).

These two points echo the two aspects of
chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo identified
by Nichikan, a seventeenth-century restorer of
Nichiren Buddhism, based on the phrase in
the “Expedient Means” chapter of the Lotus
Sutra, “exert oneself bravely and vigorously”
(see LSOC, 56; Jpn yumyo shojin). Nichikan
explains that “bravely and vigorously” (yumyo)

In chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, the
first important thing is having the challeng-
ing spirit to act with courage. nie could be
described as arousing deep faith from the
innermost reaches of our lives in accord with
Nichiren’s words, firmly believing that we can
‘summon forth the mystic truth within us,
manifest our inherent Buddhahood and
attain enlightenment in this lifetime without
fail. It also means directly taking on the three
obstacles and four devils that seek to obstruct
us from chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. We
need to have a fearless, tireless and unremit-
ting challenging spirit to confront and
overcome the diverse array of obstacles that
rise up to assail us. For it is precisely by chal-
lenging, battling and defeating ignorance that
we can polish our lives.

§ courageous!

The Path for Polishing Our Lives:
(2) Continuing

Next, continuing is vital. It is absolutely essential
for attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime.
Nichiren Daishonin says: “To accept is easy; to
continue is difficult. But Buddhahood lies in
continuing faith” (“The Difficulty of Sustaining
Faith,” WND-1, 471). In “On Attaining Buddha-
hood in This Lifetime” we see the paramount
Importance of continuing from Nichiren’s
Mpeated emphasis on the need to practice “day
pe night” and “diligently” (WND-1, 4). Main-
aining an unflagging practice of chanting

Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is a crucial requirement
for attaining Buddhahood.

Nichiren writes: “Suffer what there is to suf-
fer, enjoy what there is to enjoy. Regard both
suffering and joy as facts of life, and continue
chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, no matter
what happens. How could this be anything other
than the boundless joy of the Law?” (“Happiness
in This World.” WND-1, 681). We must continue
chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo during times
of both suffering and joy. The emphasis here is
on the word continue, and it is key that we do so
throughout “both suffering and joy.” When con-
fronted with suffering, we must not retreat. We
should “suffer what there is to suffer.” This is nei-
ther resignation nor escapism. We need to fix
our gaze unflinchingly on reality and bravely
challenge it based on chanting Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo. Nichiren is explaining that this is the
correct attitude for practitioners of the Mystic
Law. Faith in Nichiren Buddhism is constantly
directed toward transforming reality.

Of course, such a state of life is not gained
overnight. But if we steadfastly and diligently
continue making efforts to polish ourselves day
in and day out, month after month, year after
year, we will naturally and surely come to attain
it, mirroring the words of the sutra passage
“This cluster of unsurpassed jewels / has come
to us unsought” (LSOC, 124).’

Next, “enjoy what there is to enjoy” (WND-1,
681), can be taken to mean that when we're expe-
riencing joy, we should remember to have
gratitude and make even greater efforts to chant
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, aiming toward the ulti-
mate goal of attaining Buddhahood in this
lifetime. Deepening our seeking spirit in faith is
much more difficult in good times than in bad,
because in good times it is easy to grow lax and

============================================================

============================================================

On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime

self-satisfied. Rather than being someone who is
strong in adversity but weak when things are
going well, we should seek to construct the kind
of invincible faith that allows us to “regard both
suffering and joy as facts of life” (WND-1, 681).
Such strong faith is forged through our prac-
tice as Soka Gakkai members striving to achieve
the lofty goal of kosen-rufu and our own enlight-
enment in this existence. Above all, chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo—the process by which
we “diligently polish our mirror day and night”
(see WND-1, 4)—strengthens our lives in the
same way that a magnificent sword is forged and
tempered. The crux here lies in chanting with the
spirit to challenge in times of suffering, and
chanting with appreciation in times of joy.
“Continuing” is another way of saying “not
regressing.” Throughout the pages of Nichiren’s
writings, we can see his emphasis on never
regressing or backsliding in faith. To cite but a
few passages, Nichiren writes: “One . . . who
chants the daimoku, is the Thus Come One’s
emissary. Also, one who perseveres through
great persecutions and embraces the sutra from
beginning to end is the Thus Come One’s emis-
sary” (“The Farther the Source, the Longer the
Stream,” WND-1, 942); “Strengthen your faith
day by day and month after month. Should you
slacken in your resolve even a bit, devils will
take advantage” (“On Persecution Befalling the
Sage,” WND-1, 997); and “Carry through with
your faith in the Lotus Sutra. You cannot strike
fire from flint if you stop halfway” (“Earthly
Desires Are Enlightenment,” WND-1, 319).
Without a battle to conquer ignorance or
darkness, we cannot manifest the essential
nature of phenomena, or Dharma nature, And
unless we continue to wage this battle through
exerting ourselves in faith, we cannot construct

42

an unshakable state of life that is one with the
Dharma nature (namely, the life-state of Bud-
dhahood). This is because if we “slacken in our
resolve even a bit” (see WND-1, 997), as Nichi-
ren writes, we will become vulnerable to life’s
negative influences.

Also, when we exert ourselves in faith, the
three obstacles and four devils inevitably arise.
It is by defeating them that we can establish the
life-state of Buddhahood. When we polish our
lives on the most fundamental level through
the practice of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-
kyo, we can deepen, strengthen and broaden
ourselves spiritually without limit.

“Nam-myoho-renge-kyo
Is a Diligent Practice”

Nichiren Daishonin strove to share the supreme
inner state of attaining Buddhahood in this
lifetime with all his followers—and indeed all
humankind.

The true greatness of the practice of chant-
ing Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is that it enables
each person to actually manifest the same
life-state as the Buddha and lead an existence
of unsurpassed depth and meaning. This is
clearly indicated in the following well-known
passage from The Record of the Orally Transmit-
ted Teachings: “If in a single moment of life we
exhaust the pains and trials of millions of
Kalpas, then instant after instant there will arise
in us the three Buddha bodies? with which we
are eternally endowed, Nam-myoho-renge-kyo
is just such a ‘diligent’ practice” (p. 214),

)—then the life-state of the Buddha eternal-

Buddhahood) appears within us instant after
Instant.

Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is a diligent practice.
Arousing deep faith and steadfastly continuing
to chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo truly requires
constant and unflagging exertion. Persevering
single-mindedly and consistently in this practice
will lead us to attain Buddhahood in this
lifetime. Through such efforts, our inherent
Buddhahood—the Buddha eternally endowed
with the three bodies—wells forth in the form
of inexhaustible courage, perseverance, joy,
wisdom and compassion.

Praying for Brave and
Vigorous Youth To Appear

Exerting oneself means doing so bravely and
vigorously. Without courage and vigor, there is
no true exertion. The first Soka Gakkai presi-
dent, Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, also led a life of
brave and vigorous endeavor. He once said to
young people: “Exert yourselves bravely and
vigorously! Buddhism means taking action; it
means constantly striving. Even at my age,
that’s what I’m doing.”

President Toda also remarked to youth,
“Youth who wish for the happiness of humanity
should first themselves seek the essence of this
lofty philosophy of human revolution. They
should exert themselves bravely and vigorously
to fight and triumph over all manifestations of
the three powerful enemies and the three
obstacles and four devils.”

My sentiments are exactly the same. I chant
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo ardently for brave and
vigorous disciples, brave and vigorous youth, to
appear throughout the world. | am wholeheart-
edly chanting for this every day. Exerting oneself
bravely and vigorously is truly the hallmark of
the Soka Gakkai’s mentor-disciple spirit.

The practice of chanting Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo is the driving force for progress,
the driving force for victory. Every challenge
should begin with chanting Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo. No one is a match for those who
steadfastly chant.

Diligently chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo
morning and evening, let us thoroughly polish
ourselves inside and construct lives in which we
win victory after victory.

Arousing deep faith and steadfastly continuing
to chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo truly requires
constant and unflagging exertion. Persevering
single-mindedly and consistently in this practice
will lead us to attain Buddhahood in this lifetime.
Through such efforts, our inherent Buddha-
hood—the Buddha eternally endowed with the
three bodies—wells forth in the form of inex-
haustible courage, perseverance, joy, wisdom and
compassion. (p. 43)

7 € with the universe. This momentous drama
transformation is the greatest of all wonders.

Buddhism finds supreme nobility and the
Ee catial for great change in all human beings.
In On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime,”
Nichiren, therefore, concludes that when we
thoroughly polish our lives through chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, it is possible for us to
tap the life-state of Buddhahood no matter
how Steeped in delusion we may be, and to

transform even the most impure and evil land
into a pure land.

_ Myoho-renge-kyo is the name of the “mystic
truth that is originally inherent in all living
beings” (WND-1, 3), Accordingly, through the
practice of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, we
can reveal our inner Buddhahood—polishing “the
tarnished mirror of a mind now clouded by the
illusions of the innate darkness of life” into “a clear

mirror reflecting the essential nature of phenom-
ena and the true aspect of reality” (see WND-1, 4).
In other words, by manifesting the mystic truth
that resides within us, we can tap our infinite
inner potential. Buddhahood is the state of life
that is one with Myoho-renge-kyo, the originally
inherent mystic truth. Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is
also the name of this ultimate state of life.

The passage I will discuss this time explains
the relation between Myoho-renge-kyo and the
mind of living beings in terms of the elements of
myo, ho, renge and kyo. This explanation may be
seen as a description of how our lives become
one with Myoho-renge-kyo and manifest the
state of Buddhahood. Let us consider the pro-
found meaning of this passage.

The Mind Is the Mystic Entity of the
Middle Way That Is the Ultimate Reality

Nichiren Daishonin says that myo of Myoho-
renge-kyo signifies the marvelous nature of our
lives from moment to moment. And he uses the
concepts of existence and nonexistence to describe
this wondrous and unfathomable nature.

Our minds are in a state of constant flux,
moving with the ebb and flow of countless
thoughts and emotions. Nichiren notes: “When
we look into our own mind at any moment, we
perceive neither color nor form to verify that it
exists. Yet we still cannot say it does not exist, for
many differing thoughts continually occur. The
mind cannot be considered either to exist or not
to exist. Life is indeed an elusive reality that tran-
scends both the words and concepts of existence
and nonexistence. It is neither existence nor
nonexistence, yet exhibits the qualities of both”
(WND-1, 4).

47


============================================================
PAGE 55 (Layout: single)
============================================================

Nichiren describes this unfathomable
nature of the mind as the “mystic entity of the
Middle Way that is the ultimate reality” (WND-
1, 4). The Middle Way does not simply mean
the middle course between two extremes; it
refers to a more lofty perspective that is swayed
by neither extreme but also embraces them
both. Shakyamuni set forth a sound philosophy
and practice transcending the two then-pre-
vailing extremes of hedonism and asceticism,
and he called this the Middle Way. In “On
Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime.” Nich-
iren says that the ultimate truth, which
transcends the two extremes of existence and
nonexistence and yet also manifests both, is the
Middle Way, and because this is the pinnacle of
truth, he calls it the “ultimate reality.”

Transcending existence and nonexistence can
be taken to mean transcending impermanent
phenomena that alternate ceaselessly between
existence and nonexistence. Further, exhibiting
the qualities of both existence and nonexistence
while transcending both does not refer to a tran-
scendent or absolute being divorced from
impermanent phenomena, but indicates the truly
eternal that encompasses and resides within
impermanent phenomena.

Although Nichiren explains the mysterious
nature of life or mind in terms of the concepts
of existence and nonexistence in this writing,
what he says here is comparable to Nagarjuna’s
concept of nonsubstantiality,' and to T’ien-
Vai’s concepts of the unification of the three
truths’ and the threefold contemplation in a
single mind.’ Essentially, “the mystic entity of
the Middle Way that is the ultimate reality” of
which Nichiren speaks refers to our lives or
minds that are one with the ultimate truth—a
concept expressed variously as nonsubstantial-
ity, the unification of the three truths, or
threefold contemplation in a single mind.

48

On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime

Renge Refers to the Principle of the
Simultaneity of Cause and Effect

Nichiren Daishonin next states that ho, meaning
Law or phenomena, is the name given to the
manifestations of the mystic nature of our lives or
minds—a term that can also be expressed as the
wondrous mind or the “mind of myo.” The mind
of myo is itself the Mystic Law. Abstract words
and theories alone—be they the concepts of
nonsubstantiality or the unification of the three
truths—cannot be called the Mystic Law. For only
when the Mystic Law is expressed as the highest
human wisdom based on the Middle Way can it
spread as a guide and compass, and as a teaching
or Law (ho) for people to follow.

In addition, Nichiren says: “Renge, which
means lotus flower, is used to symbolize the won-
der of this Law” (WND-1, 4). The Mystic Law is
not visible to the human eye. Therefore, the Bud-
dha uses a concrete symbol in order to help
people understand the Law’s wondrous and mys-
tic nature. This is renge, meaning “lotus flower.”

Why does he employ the lotus flower? Usually
plants flower first and then bear fruit—a relation-
ship that is used to illustrate linear or sequential
causality, with the flowers representing the cause
and the fruit the effect. In Buddhism, this is
referred to as the nonsimultaneity of cause and
effect. By contrast, the lotus flower puts forth its
petals and its receptacle (which contains its fruit)
simultaneously—in other words,
duced at the same time its petals
thus symbolizes the princi
of cause and effect,

The provisional teachings other than the Lotus
Sutra do not teach that Buddhahood is inherent
within the lives of ordinary people, which is
regarded as the cause for attaining enlightenment.
Rather, they teach that one can only gain the state
of Buddhahood after undergoing countless eons of

seal by day, through consistently chanting
-myoho-renge-kyo, we can accumulate the
causes and effects for attaining Buddhahood that
make it possible to transform a mind clouded by
the innate darkness of life into a mind reflecting
the essential nature of phenomena and the true
aspect of reality (see WND-1, 4). The virtues of
these causes and effects over time become the

bone and marrow of our beings, with flowers of
benefit blossoming in our characters and in our
lives. This is the mystic kyo in terms of our indi-
vidual lives.

Also, we can regard this mystic kyo as the
spread of the Mystic Law from ourselves to
others. When “the mind at this moment” is
understood to mean the Buddha’s mind and “the
mind at other moments” is taken to mean the
minds of all living beings, then kyo refers to the
Buddha’s teachings that expound aspects of his
enlightenment regarding the mystic nature of
life, or the mind of myo. And the king of sutras
that directly elucidates the mind of myo itself is
the Lotus Sutra, the essence of which is Myoho-
renge-kyo. In that sense, the development of
kosen-rufu, with people propagating the Mystic
Law and chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo
unstintingly for their own happiness and that of
others and teaching others to do the same, could
be said to correspond to the mystic kyo.

As seen in the aforementioned discussion,
Myoho-renge-kyo is the Law inherent in our own
lives. The ongoing moment-to-moment transfor-
mation in our hearts and minds that we achieve
through chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo not
only leads to a fundamental inner change but to a
change in the entire way we live our lives, putting
us on track to attain Buddhahood in this lifetime.
And it further creates a groundswell for the great
transformation of all humankind that is kosen-
rufu. The dynamic force for change on all levels is
Myoho-renge-kyo.

Becoming the Masters of Our Minds

Since Myoho-renge-kyo is the Law inherent within

- our lives, there is another topic I must touch on.

Namely, the relation between the mind of delu-
sion clouded by innate darkness and the mind

49


============================================================
PAGE 57 (Layout: single)
============================================================

of myo illuminated by the essential nature of phe-
nomena and the true aspect of reality.

If we follow the deluded minds of ordinary
people—minds that tend to be weak and easily
swayed—our inner potential can rapidly wither
Or, €ven worse, we may succumb to negative and
destructive impulses. This is a problem stemming
from the subtlety of the mind. Because our minds
are the key to attaining Buddhahood in this
lifetime, we must overcome our own inner weak-
nesses. This is what our Buddhist practice is all
about. The deluded minds of ordinary people are
constantly wavering. We must not make such
wavering minds our basis or guide.

Nichiren Daishonin emphasizes this by citing
the well-known passage “Become the master of
your mind rather than let your mind master you”
(“Letter to the Brothers,” WND-1, 502). This pas-
to the effect: “Our minds may suddenly Tun out of
control. Therefore, we must tame them like a wild
elephant, not allowing our minds to become our
masters, but rather seeking to master our minds”4
The Nirvana Sutra contains a similar Passage,
“May I be the master of my mind and not let my
mind become my master!” (“Letter to Renjo,”
WND-2, 5). Nichiren cites this admonition many
times, making it a guideline for his followers.

Becoming the master of one’s mind means
having a sound compass in life and the bright
beacon of faith. We must not be mastered by ordi-
nary people’s inconstant, weak and ever-changing
minds of delusion. To master our minds, we must
guide them in the right direction. In that sense,
the true master of the mind is the Law and the
teachings of the Buddha. Shakyamuni vowed to
make the Law to which he had become enlight-
ened the master of his mind, and he took pride in

living true to that vow. This is the way of life of
“taking refuge in the Law” that Shakyamuni
emphasized in his final injunction to his disciples
before he died.s

The priests of the various Buddhist schools
during Nichiren’s lifetime had forgotten this
spirit of Shakyamuni. Following their own arbi-
trary minds or thinking, they lost sight of the
Buddha's teachings, denigrated the Lotus Sutra
and succumbed to arrogance. By contrast, Nichi-
ren taught that the true master of the mind is
Myoho-renge-kyo—the heart of the Lotus Sutra
and the fundamental Law of all Buddhas—and
set forth the concrete Practice of chanting Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo for mastering one’s mind. Also,
he frequently stressed to his followers the impor-
tant spirit of faith to seek this true master of the
mind—the Mystic Law.

For example, when, on account of his faith, the
elder of the Ikegami brothers‘ was disowned by
their father, Nichiren encouraged the two brothers,
saying that this was Precisely the time for them,
based on faith, to unite and overcome the situa-
tion. He offers them this guidance: “A Passage in

you. Whatever trouble Occurs, regard it as no more

es a dream, and think only of the Lotus Sutra”
(“Letter to the Brothers,” WND-1, 502)

he Conversely, to become the master of our
Minds is to live based on the Law.

A teacher or mentor in Buddhism is one who
leads and connects people to the Law—teaching
them that the Law on which they should depend
already exists within their own lives. The disciples
in turn seek the mentor, who embodies and is one
with the Law. Looking to the mentor as a model,
they exert themselves in their Buddhist practice.
In this way, they lead lives in which they become
Masters of their minds.

In other words, the existence of a mentor—
one who embodies and lives in complete accord
with the Law, and who teaches people about the
vast inner potential they possess—is indispen-
sable for attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime.
I had a mentor who practiced as the Buddha
taught—our second Soka Gakkai president,
Josei Toda, who dedicated his life to widely

propagating Nichiren Buddhism in the modern
age—and that has made me who I am today.
President Toda is always with me as my spiritual
mentor, Even now, day after day, and moment
by moment, I am carrying on a dialogue with

my mentor in my heart. This is the spirit of the
oneness of mentor and disciple. Those who
hold fast to their spiritual mentor as their com-
pass and exert themselves as that mentor
teaches are people who live based on the Law.
Nichiren Buddhism is a teaching founded on
the oneness of mentor and disciple. And the
Lotus Sutra is likewise a scripture of the oneness
of mentor and disciple.

At the end of this writing, to convey the
importance of the mentor-disciple relationship
in walking the great path of attaining Buddha-
hood in this lifetime, Nichiren cites a passage
from the “Supernatural Powers” chapter of the
Lotus Sutra.” Next time, I will discuss the pro-
found meaning of this passage, but suffice it to
say here that the path to attaining Buddhahood
is found in the practice of Bodhisattvas of
the Earth who chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo,
the Law inherent in their lives, for both their
own happiness and that of others, and who teach
others to do the same.

Above all, the great path to attaining Buddha-
hood in this lifetime lies in practicing faith with
the spirit of the oneness of mentor and disciple,
making our minds one with the lofty mind of
the Buddha and not being swayed by our inner
darkness or the three poisons—greed, anger and
foolishness. Faith based on the mentor-disciple
spirit is the key to opening the treasure within
our lives that is as vast as the universe. Moreover,
courageously exerting ourselves in chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and taking action for
kosen-rufu is the direct path to attaining Buddha-
hood in this lifetime.

Key Points

The Meaning of Myo—the Middle Way

Nichiren describes this unfathomable nature of the
mind as the “mystic entity of the Middle Way that is
the ultimate reality” (WND-1, 4). The Middle Way
does not simply mean the middle course between
two extremes; it refers to a more lofty perspective
that is swayed by neither extreme but also
embraces them both. Shakyamuni set forth a
sound philosophy and practice transcending the
two then-prevailing extremes of hedonism and
asceticism, and he called this the Middle Way. In
On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime,”
Nichiren says that the ultimate truth, which
transcends the two extremes of existence and
Honexistence and yet also manifests both, is the
Middle Way, and because this is the pinnacle of
truth, he calls it the “ultimate reality” Transcending
€xistence and nonexistence can be taken to mean
transcending impermanent phenomena that
alternate ceaselessly between existence and nonex-
Istence, Further, exhibiting the qualities of both
existence and nonexistence while transcending
both does not refer to a transcendent or absolute
being divorced from impermanent phenomena,
but indicates the truly eternal that encompasses and
resides within impermanent phenomena. (p. 48)

The Meaning of Renge—
the Simultaneity of Cause and Effect

The Mystic Law is not visible to the human eye.
Therefore, the Buddha uses a concrete symbol in
order to help people understand the Law’s won-
drous and mystic nature. This is renge, meaning
“lotus flower.” Why does he employ the lotus
flower? Usually plants flower first and then bear
fruit—a relationship that is used to illustrate
linear or sequential causality, with the flowers
representing the cause and the fruit the effect. In
Buddhism, this is referred to as the nonsimultane-
ity of cause and effect. By contrast, the lotus flower
puts forth its petals and its receptacle (which con-
tains its fruit) simultaneously—in other words, its
fruit is produced at the same time its petals open.
The lotus thus symbolizes the principle of the
simultaneity of cause and effect. (p. 48)

The Meaning of Kkyo—the Practice
for Oneself and Others

We can regard this mystic kyo as the spread of the
Mystic Law from ourselves to others. When “the
mind at this moment” is understood to mean the
Buddha’s mind and “the mind at other moments”
is taken to mean the minds of all living beings,
then kyo refers to the Buddha’s teachings that
expound aspects of his enlightenment regarding
the mystic nature of life, or the mind of myo.
And the king of sutras that directly elucidates
the mind of myo itself is the Lotus Sutra, the
essence of which is Myoho-renge-kyo. In that
sense, the development of kosen-rufu, with peo-
ple propagating the Mystic Law and chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo unstintingly for their
own happiness and that of others and teaching
others to do the same, could be said to corre-
spond to the mystic kyo. (p. 49)

Mastering One’s Mind—
the Path of Mentor and Disciple

To allow ourselves to be mastered by our minds
is to lead a self-centered existence. Ultimately,
we will be pulled this way and that by our con-
stantly wavering minds, succumb to egoism and
sink into the depths of darkness or ignorance.
Conversely, to become the master of our minds
is to live based on the Law. A teacher or mentor
in Buddhism is one who leads and connects
people to the Law—teaching them that the Law
on which they should depend already exists
within their own lives, The disciples in turn seek
the mentor, who embodies and is one with the
Law. Looking to the mentor as a model, they
exert themselves in their Buddhist practice. In
this way, they lead lives in which they become
masters of their minds. In other words, the
existence of a mentor—one who embodies and
lives in complete accord with the Law, and who
teaches people about the vast inner potential
they possess—is indispensable for attaining
Buddhahood in this lifetime. (p. 51)

If we do not harbor doubts in our
hearts, we will as a matter of course
attain Buddhahood. (“The Opening of
the Eyes,” WND-1, 283)

Because Myoho-renge-kyo is the inherent
Law of life to which the Buddha became
enlightened, chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo
represents an unerring practice for us to gain
enlightenment, Hence, Nichiren says, “You are
certain to attain Buddhahood in this lifetime”

(WND-1, 4):

—_—

We may call it the most natural path, how-
ever, that does not mean that we do not have to
make personal effort. As with any path, in order
to enable many people to follow it, the way has
to be opened, obstructions must be removed
and a clear pathway must be trodden. Similarly,
the path of chanting entails a struggle to
maintain faith that Myoho-renge-kyo exists
within us and to defeat the fundamental dark-
ness inherent in our lives.

When we embrace the five characters of
Myoho-renge-kyo, we can positively transform
the cycles of negativity, delusion and suffering
that our lives have repeatedly undergone as 4
result of innate darkness or ignorance. We can
naturally engrave deep within us the causality
for attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime.

Here, faith is the cause, and manifesting
the life-state of Buddhahood is the effect.
“To engrave the causality for attaining Bud-
dhahood deep in our lives,” therefore, is to
vanquish through faith the inner darkness that
is the source of evil and misery, and to bring
the rhythm of Myoho-renge-kyo, the inherent
mystic truth, to pulse vibrantly in our lives. The
life-state of Buddhahood is perfectly in tune
with this rhythm of Myoho-renge-kyo.

Through chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo,
the causality of Buddhahood will come to sup-
plant the causality of negativity that has existed
in our lives. And when we forge strong faith
that is impervious to any attack of fundamen-
tal darkness or devilish functions, the causality
for attaining Buddhahood takes root in the
very core of our beings.

Faith, therefore, is absolutely crucial. That is
why Nichiren underscores the importance of
having “deep faith” in sharing the principle that
our lives are entities of the Mystic Law (see

55

============================================================

WND-1, 4). Indeed, we find Nichiren stressing
the importance of faith throughout “On
Attaining Buddhahood in this Lifetime.” For
instance, he writes: “Summon up deep faith”
(WND-1, 3), and “Arouse deep faith” (WND-1,
4). He teaches that deepening our faith is the
royal road to achieving enlightenment.

The key to our enlightenment as ordinary
people ultimately depends on how deeply we
can believe this truth—that, by manifesting the
Mystic Law inherent within our lives, we can
definitely attain Buddhahood.

“Were They Not Bodhisattvas
of the Earth, They Could Not
Chant the Daimoku”

The kind of faith needed for attaining Buddha-
hood in this lifetime could thus be described as
the hallmark of Bodhisattvas of the Earth.’
“thoroughly forged faith” (“General Stone
Tiger,” WND-1, 953).

At the end of “On Attaining Buddhahood in
passage from the “Supernatural Powers of the
“After I have passed into extinction, [one]
should accept and uphold this sutra. Such a
person assuredly and without doubt will attain
the Buddha way” (LSOC, 318). He quotes this
as scriptural evidence of gaining enlighten-
ment through chanting the daimoku [or title]
of the Lotus Sutra, Myoho-renge-kyo. We can
read this passage to mean that the thoroughly
forged faith of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth is

56

On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime

precisely the faith required for attaining Bud-
dhahood in this lifetime.

In the “Supernatural Powers” chapter,
Shakyamuni Buddha transfers the essence of
the Lotus Sutra’ to Bodhisattva Superior Prac-
tices and the other Bodhisattvas of the Earth.
He then outlines how these bodhisattvas
should exert themselves in propagating the
sutra after his passing. The above passage
cited by Nichiren at the end of “On Attaining
Buddhahood in This Lifetime” is the conclud-
ing part of Shakyamuni’s description of
benefits to be gained as a result of those
efforts. Here, “[one] should accept and
uphold this sutra” means accepting and
upholding the daimoku of the Lotus Sutra,
Myoho-renge-kyo—the essence of the teach-
ing transmitted by the Buddha to Bodhisattva
Superior Practices.

In “The True Aspect of All Phenomena,”
Nichiren writes, “Were they not Bodhisattvas of
the Earth, they could not chant the daimoku”
(WND-1, 385). What is it that makes the chant-
ing of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo so difficult then?
Viewed from one perspective, it is because
breaking through fundamental darkness and
triumphing over devilish functions requires us
to chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo with strong,
thoroughly forged faith.

Chanting and Teaching Others
To Do the Same

Further, the true significance of the Bodhi-
sattvas of the Earth’s practice of chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo lies in their not only
carrying out this practice themselves but teach-
ing others to do the same. In other words, it is
a practice for both self and others,



============================================================

============================================================

In his treatise “The Three Great Secret

Laws” Nichiren Daishonin notes that, in the
Middle Day of the Law, Tien-t’ai and his
teacher Nan-Yiieh both chanted the daimoku
of the Lotus Sutra, but they did so merely as a
private practice and did not teach it to others.
Nichiren clarifies that, in contrast, he not only
chants it himself but teaches this practice to
others.?

The daimoku of the Middle Day remained
merely an emblem for perceiving the mystic
truth; it was not employed to actually lead peo-
ple to enlightenment, In contrast, the daimoku
of Nichiren Daishonin encompasses both prac-
tice for oneself and others—it has the actual
power, when chanted with thoroughly forged
faith, to break through fundamental darkness
and enable all ir i
see people to reveal their innate

Meeting in Tokyo, japan.

Also, in “The Object of Devotion for
Observing the Mind,” Nichiren refers to the
ng that he established as
the “actual practice of the five characters of
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo” (WND-1, 375). “Actual
practice” here means chanting Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo in terms of both faith and practice,*
and establishing the causality of Buddhahood
as a reality in one’s life.

The actual practice of daimoku of the
Bodhisattvas of the Earth in the Latter Day of
the Law means chanting Nam-myoho-renge-
kyo for the enlightenment of all people—a
practice aiming for the happiness of both
oneself and others. As Nichiren indicates
when he says “At first only Nichiren chanted
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, but then two, three,
and a hundred followed,” the essence of this
practice is chanting it ourselves and also

Our second Soka Gakkai president, Josei
Toda, taught us the substance of the great state
of Buddhahood in concrete terms. Mr. Toda’s
life was not an easy, uneventful one; it was a
life of painful vicissitudes.

To seek in Buddhism a life of peace and
quiet, free of trouble, goes against its basic
tenets. The lives of Shakyamuni Buddha and
Nichiren Daishonin were fierce struggles, any-
1 | thing but tranquil and trouble-free.

_ he It could be said that the genuine spirit of
sidents | ism lies in establishing a towering,
uctible state of life that not even the
t obstacle can harm. True attainment
ahood in this lifetime means con-
ens id em that will absolutely not
Lee d by devilish functions. This is
i pont hepa and Nichiren taught
their own examples.



============================================================
PAGE 66 (Layout: single)
============================================================

Viewed from the Buddhist perspective,
Mr, Toda dedicated his life to demonstrating
the state of Buddhahood of one who follows
pe highest human path. As his true, direct dis-
ciple, I proudly proclaim the great victory of
my mentor’s human revolution.

Overflowing With Life Force,
Fulfilling Our Mission

But yest what is attaining Buddhahood? In
discussing this question, President Toda con-
stantly declared it meant securing eternal
happiness. “Attaining Buddhahood,” he said,
em achieving a state of being that allows us
ao be reborn overflowing with powerful
€ force, to fulfill our mission to our heart’s
content, to achieve all our goals and to possess
800d fortune that no one can destroy.” These
ae words of true philosophy that get at the
a oe attaining Buddhahood in language
at is simple and straightforward.

Mr. Toda continued, “And is it not greater
still if we can enjoy tens, hundreds, thousands,
tens of millions of existences in this way?” I can
still hear his voice ringing in my ears, filled with
indomitable confidence and conviction like the
mighty roar of a lion king.

Those who have dedicated themselves to the
Mystic Law will, on each successive rebirth,
overflow with vibrant life force, accomplish
a mission for kosen-rufu that only they can
achieve and enjoy immense, indestructible
good fortune. They can joyfully savor such lives
again and again.

Attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime, one
could say, allows us to solidly enter this eternal
path, Countless Soka Gakkai members have

—=—-_

done so. As long as actual proof of the Mystic
Law continues to blossom brilliantly in each
person’s life, the faith of the Soka Gakkai will
shine eternally. Mr. Toda declared that the life of
each Soka Gakkai member would be recorded
in future sutras as “Soka Gakkai Buddha.”

Of course, each aspect of birth, aging, sick-
ness and death is part of the reality of our lives
in this world. Our physical bodies cannot
escape the changes found in the cycle of forma-
tion, continuance, decline and disintegration to
which all phenomena in the universe are sub-
ject. Naturally, our bodies deteriorate as we
age. If practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism
were to retain youthful bodies forever, it would
go against the laws of nature! As we thoroughly
polish ourselves through faith, however, the
inner essence of our lives will never decay.

I hope that all our pioneering and senior
members who have dedicated themselves to
kosen-rufu with such sincerity over the years
will cheerfully, proudly adorn the final chapter
of their lives with noble victory, confident of
this point. Please continue to strive with the
spirit of fresh challenge! Looking at Nichiren’s
writings, there is absolutely no doubt that those
who forge such a fighting spirit in this existence
do attain the lofty spiritual state allowing them
to make their way freely, joyfully, through the
journey of eternal life.

In describing this free, untrammeled state
of life that continues across eternity and
encompasses the entire universe, Mr. Toda
would often say humorously: “We die, but we
are reborn. For my part, I would like to come
back as a stunning beauty!” He would then go
on to joke that this beauty would be famous
around the world, with people flocking to buy
her photos and get her autograph. Of course,

he said, she would never give her autograph to
bad or hateful people.

Mr. Toda died at fifty-eight—not an old age
by any means. The two years he had spent in
prison for his beliefs during World War II had
left his health seriously damaged. And the
intense frenzy of activity over the next several
years, which saw him work all out to rebuild
the Soka Gakkai and fulfill his duties as presi-
dent, also brought bouts of illness.

When a Soka Gakkai leader once asked him
why he was ill, Mr. Toda answered: “My being
sick like this represents a great lessening of

Mr. Toda, inspired by the majestic form
of indomitable Mount Fuji, dauntlessly took
the lead for kosen-rufu until his very last
moment. I firmly believe his noble life is an
example to all of us of attaining Buddhahood
in this lifetime.

The Lion’s Roar of Mentor
and Disciple United

Without a challenging or fighting spirit, we
cannot attain Buddhahood. Through that sort
of spirit, the causality of attaining Buddhahood
becomes established as a solid, shining pillar of
our lives. The term fighting spirit can also be
expressed in various other ways, such as: the
spirit of “true cause,” of always starting from
now; the resolve to never regress in faith; the
heart of a lion king; the refusal to be defeated;
faith that grows stronger day by day.
Thus Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, chanted with
this spirit, is none other than the source of infinite
advance. No painful difficulty or karma is an
obstacle for the daimoku of lion kings. Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo has the power to turn adversity
into a springboard for growth, to change karma
into mission, to transform even sorrow into a
wellspring of creativity, Nichiren Daishonin’s very
life pulses in Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.

“The daimoku of Soka Gakkai members
g for kosen-rufu is the same as the
chanted by our first and second

esidents, Mr, Makiguchi and Mr. Toda, to

1. Bodhisattvas of the Earth: Disciples of Shakyamuni from the remote
ren whom he calls forth in the “Emerging from the Earth” chapter of
Lotus Sutra and entrusts with propagating the Lotus Sutra after his
Passing. They are known as Bodhisattvas of the Earth for they appear

A from the earth. Their leader is called Superior Practices.

. Transfer of the essence of the Lotus Sutra; In the “Supernatural
Powers” chapter of the Lotus Sutra, Shakyamuni entrusts the sutra’s
teaching to Bodhisattva Superior Practices and the other iss
of the Earth. This is called the “transfer of the essence” because
Shakyamuni describes the sutra as containing: 1) “all the doctrines
possessed by the Thus Come One”; 2) “all the freely exercised super-
natural powers of the Thus Come One”; 3) “the storehouse of all the
secret essentials of the Thus Come One”; and 4) “all the most profound
matters of the Thus Come One,” adding that “all these are proclaimed,
revealed, and clearly expounded in this sutra” (LSOC, 316).

3. Nichiren writes, “Now, however, we have entered the Latter Day of the
Law, and the daimoku that I, Nichiren, chant is different from that of
earlier ages. This Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. encompasses both practice
for oneself and the teaching of others” (“On the Receiving of the Three
Great Serre’ Laress Waites 10 (Nam-myoho-renge-kyo) has

7 daimoku of the esse! teac! ‘am-ny renge- ‘

‘ ke aspects: the daimoku of faith and the daimoku of practice. The

former means to believe in the Gohonzon, the latter to chant Nam-

myoho- renge-kyo and spread it.

5, Six difficult and nine easy acts: The “Treasure Tower” chapter of the
Lotus Sutra explains from six perspectives the difficulty of practicing
the Lotus Sutra after Shakyamuni’s passing. By contrast, it describes
nine seemingly impossible actions, such as throwing Mount Sumeru
into another world system, 2s comparatively easy (see LSOC 218-19).

6. Three powerful enemies: The verse section of the “Encouraging
Devotion™ chapter of the Lotus Sutra describes the people who will
persecute a person who spreads the Lotus Sutra in the evil age after
Shakyamuni's passing. In his Annotations on “The Words and Phrases
of the Lotus Sutra,” Miao-lo describes these people as belonging to
three categories: arrogant lay people, arrogant monks and nuns, and
arrogant false sages (see LSOC, 233-34),

7. Lessening karmic retribution; The principle that one can experience
the etfects of bad karma from the past to a lesser degree because of
Buddhist faith and practice.

[which means ‘teacher’, is the Wonderful Law that is passed on by the

sound of the teacher and the disciples chanting in unison” (OTT, 111).

Key Points

The Path of Chanting

Is the Natural Way To

Achieve Enlightenment
The path of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is,
in a sense, the most natural way for human beings
to achieve enlightenment. This is because it is the
means for us to reveal the “mystic truth that is
originally inherent” in our lives (see WND-1, 3).
Nichiren emphasizes the very natural way in
which chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo allows us
to manifest this innate mystic truth. (pp. 54-55)

ha

Faith Dedicated to Kosen-rufu

The actual practice of daimoku of the Bodhj-
sattvas of the Earth in the Latter Day of the Law
means chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo for the
enlightenment of all people—a practice aiming
for the happiness of both oneself and others, As
Nichiren indicates when he says “At first only
Nichiren chanted Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, but
then two, three, and a hundred followed,” the
essence of this practice is chanting it ourselves
and also teaching it to others (“The True Aspect
of All Phenomena,” WND-1, 385).

The Nam-myoho-renge-kyo chanted by the
Bodhisattvas of the Earth is characterized by
deep, thoroughly forged faith to overcome dark-
ness and devilish functions, and by practice for
both ourselves and others. Its essence, in short, is
faith dedicated to kosen-rufu. (pp. 57-58)

Opening the Life-State of Buddhahood

A fighting faith through which we take on and
overcome the three obstacles and four devils opens
the life-state of Buddhahood. There is no attaining
enlightenment without struggling against the three
powerful enemies. Those who work unceasingly
for kosen-rufu are genuine Buddhas, (p. 58)

Attaining Buddhahood
With a Challenging Spirit

Without a challenging or fighting spirit, we can-
Not attain Buddhahood. Through that sort of
‘spirit, the causality of attaining Buddhahood
$ established as a solid, shining pillar of
our lives. The term fighting spirit can also be
expressed in various other ways, such as: the
spirit of “true cause,” of always starting from now;
the resolve to never regress in faith; the heart of a
lion king; the refusal to be defeated; faith that
BrOws stronger day by day, (p. 60)

Key Points:

The Essence of Chanting

Nam-myoho-renge-kyo
The Law contained in the practice of chanting
spread by Nichiren is truly wondrous, But even the
power of this wondrous Law cannot fully manifest
in a life clouded by ignorance. Ignorance is the
inner darkness that prevents us from believing in
the Mystic Law and staying focused on our own
Buddha nature and that of others. The practice of
chanting enables us to break through this darkness
and vibrantly bring forth our Buddhahood. Bat-
tling our fundamental darkness—this inner
struggle is the essence of chanting Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo. (p. 29)

The Heart of Buddhism

If we seek enlightenment outside of us, we are not
pursuing the path of “observing one’s mind,”
which enables us to overcome the fundamental evil
of ignorance or darkness. In that case, all our
be lacking the vital ingredient; they will be every
bit as futile as counting a neighbor's vast riches.
Moreover, because none of these efforts will help
us eradicate our ignorance, they will only become
“an endless, painful austerity.” This battle against
ignorance is the heart of Buddhism. (p. 30)

The Driving Force for

Our Transformation
If we chant to the Gohonzon but always blame
other people or our environment for our circum-
stances, we are avoiding the challenge of tackling
our inner darkness or ignorance. By doing so, we
are seeking enlightenment outside of us. By chang-
ing ourselves on a more profound level that we
can begin to improve our situation. Chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is the driving force for that
change. (p. 31)

On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime

Confident and Concrete Prayer
The erroneous belief that Myoho-renge-kyo (the
Mystic Law) exists outside of our lives has at its
core an inability to believe that all people—our-
selves and others—possess the Buddha nature.
And this disbelief stems from fundamental dark-
ness. In terms of attitude in faith, this tendency to
skeptically regard the Buddha nature as “a nice
ideal but one that doesn’t really change reality” will
manifest itself as prayer that is vague and lacking in
conviction. If our efforts in faith are halfhearted,
we cannot change our attitude or fundamentally
transform our lives. As Nichiren indicates in this
writing when he says, “You must summon up deep
faith” (WND-1, 3), if we hope to make our inher-
ent Buddha nature the basis of our lives—or as
Nichiren terms it, to attain Buddhahood in this
lifetime—we must continue striving to deepen our
faith, our conviction in chanting Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo. And as our faith deepens, it will
manifest as confident and concrete prayer. (p. 43)

Overcoming Grumbling
and Complaining

Grumbling and complaining are the principal
gateways to ambiguous, elusive doubt and disbe-
lief. Even if we know it is wrong, we may find
ourselves grumbling and complaining in spite of
ourselves. Should such behavior become habitual,
it will act as a constant brake on our growth and
cause us to forget about advancing and improving
ourselves, We will then effectively close off our own
potential, falling into the path of seeking the Law
outside of us. While it might be a real challenge to
stop grumbling and complaining, we can derive
from the Mystic Law the wisdom to control these
tendencies and use them as a springboard for pos-
itive growth and development. (p. 32)

The Vimalakirti Sutra states that, when one seeks the Buddhas’ emancipation
in the minds of ordinary beings, one finds that ordinary beings are the entities
of enlightenment, and that the sufferings of birth and death are nirvana. It
also states that, if the minds of living beings are impure, their land is also
impure, but if their minds are pure, so is their land. There are not two lands,
pure or impure in themselves. The difference lies solely in the good or evil of
our minds,

It is the same with a Buddha and an ordinary being. When deluded, one is
called an ordinary being, but when enlightened, one is called a Buddha. This
is similar to a tarnished mirror that will shine like a jewel when polished. A
mind now clouded by the illusions of the innate darkness of life is like a tar-
nished mirror, but when polished, it is sure to become like a clear mirror,
reflecting the essential nature of phenomena [i.e the Dharma nature] and the
true aspect of reality. Arouse deep faith, and diligently polish your mirror day
and night. How should you polish it? Only by chanting Nam-myoho-renge-
kyo. (“On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime,” The Writings of Nichiren Daishonin, vol. 1, p. 4)

the great treasure storehouse that brings good
fortune and happiness to all. The important thing
is to live out our lives based on and completely in
sync with the Law; it is to imbue and solidify our
lives with the Mystic Law.

Our daily realities are filled with an endless
succession of problems. But with the firm belief
that our lives are Myoho-renge-kyo, we should
strive to boldly challenge everything with the
unwavering conviction that we can overcome all
hardships and become happy without fail. When
we maintain deep faith based on the foundation
that “I am Myoho-renge-kyo,” we can take on any
problem with courage. The key to victory in life
lies in whether we can bring forth courage. Not a
shrinking timidity but a challenging courage—
this is what we need to have!

Irrespective of the obstacles we may encounter
in the course of our practice, we must not retreat
a single step. We must not be alarmed or startled
by them. The power of the Mystic Law (Myoho-
deeply confident of this is most important.
ing our environment are to believe that the Law is
outside our own lives. So is losing confidence in
turning to others in the hope that they will save
us, or blaming others for our problems, or giving
in to hopelessness and resignation.

When difficulties beset us, no matter how try-
ing they may be, we must clearly see them for the
obstacles or devilish functions they are and battle
against them without retreating. This is the way
of life of those who chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo
and dedicate their lives to the Mystic Law.
Nichiren Daishonin says, “[My] disciples cannot
accomplish anything if they are cowardly” (“The
Teaching, Practice, and Proof,” WND-1, 481). In

On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime

accord with these words, let’s cast aside cowardice
and make courage our foremost attribute.

People of courageous faith can break through
the dark clouds of fear, ignorance and delusion to
bring the sun of the Mystic Law to shine and
beautiful flowers of Myoho-renge—the lotus of
the Mystic Law—to bloom in their lives.

President Toda gave the following guidance to
young women’s division members in the pioneer-
ing days of our movement: “You should take
pride in possessing the same life as the Buddha of
the Latter Day. Win in life with a noble spirit. You
must absolutely never depreciate yourselves.”

Nichiren Buddhism starts from the realization
that the supreme life-condition of Buddhahood
exists in each of us. It is a teaching that makes it
possible for us to achieve the profoundest inner
transformation—a transformation of our funda-
mental attitude or mind-set. That’s why Nichiren
emphasizes the importance of our minds, of
what's in our hearts.

He writes: “Whether you chant the Buddha's
name, recite the sutra, or merely offer flowers and
incense, all your virtuous acts will implant benefits
and roots of goodness in your life. With this convic-
tion you should strive in faith” (WND-1, 4). All our
efforts in faith—including our practice of reciting
the Lotus Sutra and chanting Nam-myoho-renge-
kyo each morning and evening, as well as all of our
various Soka Gakkai activities—are virtuous acts
that “implant benefits and roots of goodness” in
our lives. Those who advance with this deep aware-
ness will be true victors who travel the direct path
to attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime.

Always upholding the great philosophy
embodied in Nichiren’s words “It is the heart that
is important” (WND-1, 1000), let us lead magnif-
icent, victorious lives!

ourselves and others. Not to believe in the Buddha
peur is to deny the spirit of the Lotus Sutra,
which teaches that all people have the potential for
Buddhahood. Consequently, Nichiren sternly
warns that if we go against the spirit of the sutra,
Not only won't we accomplish our desire to attain
Buddhahood in this lifetime, but we will end up
committing slander of the Law."

Also, unless we practice together united in the
Spirit of “many in body, one in mind,” the great
desire for kosen-rufu cannot be fulfilled."

Let us confirm once again that chanting Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo for the happiness of ourselves
and others is the true means for attaining Bud-
dhahood in this lifetime. Each person has the
potential to become a Buddha.

The Spirit of the First Three Presidents
Pulses in the Soka Gakkai

A Buddhist teaching that affirms the existence of
the Law in each person's life is one that treasures
the individual. It calls out to each person, encour-
ages his or her individual human revolution and
seeks to lead all people to enlightenment. In the

of one person after another embracing

appearance
as steadily

faith, we find the principle of bodhisattv:
emerging from the earth to propagate the Law, and
the unchanging formula of kosen-rufu."

This is the path of the Soka Gakkai that the first
three presidents—Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, Josei
Toda and myself—have steadfastly followed.
‘That is why the Soka Gakkai has achieved such phe-
nomenal development and why out kosen-rufu
movement has spread throughout the entire world.

In contrast, Buddhist teachings that view the
Law as existing outside one’s own life tend to be
authoritarian or formalistic, to disregard and
repress people. They are prone to emphasizing rit-
uals or clerical authority, while their followers
passively seek to assuage their anxieties through
dependence on ceremonies or clergy. Further, tak-
ing advantage of the fact that one of human beings’
greatest sources of anxiety is death and what comes
after, Buddhist schools of this kind in Japan have
come to function almost exclusively as purveyors
of funeral and memorial services for the deceased,
devolving into what is known as “funeral Bud-
dhism.” They offer no philosophy that empowers
people or enables them to live better lives.

The Soka Gakkai’s founder, President
Makiguchi, asserted that Nichiren Buddhism is a
“teaching for transforming one’s life.” To believe
that the Mystic Law of Myoho-renge-kyo exists
within us is to have the confidence that we will
definitely become happy and attain Buddhahood
in this lifetime. Faith also means actively working
for kosen-rufu through sharing Nichiren Bud-
dhism based om the conviction that it holds the
key to happiness for both ourselves and others.
This genuine faith pervades the Soka Gakkai and
the SGI. The greatness of the Soka Gakkai and the
first three presidents’ spirit of the oneness of
mentor and disciple shine in the undertaking this
most difficult of challenges—that of awakening
people to the Law within.

President Toda used to say, “You should
resolve, ‘I am Myoho-renge-kyo!”” The Mystic
Law is the “highly effective medicine” (The Lotus
Sutra and Its Opening and Closing Sutras, p. 269)
that relieves the sufferings of all people. It is also

ment to truth and justice never lose

hope, even amid the greatest hardship or
difficulty. Rather, they serve as a bright beacon
illuminating the darkness of people’s suffering,
imparting inspiration, assurance and courage.

When we change, the world changes. The
key to all change is in our inner transforma-
tion—a change in our hearts and minds. This is
human revolution. We all have the power to
change. When we realize this truth of life, we
can bring forth that power anywhere, anytime
and in any situation.

Nichiren Buddhism, based on the transfor-
mative principles of the Lotus Sutra, has made
this great path of inner change available to
all people, with the chanting of Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo as its core practice.

Nichiren outlines the basic attitude
and approach to our fundamental practice of

Changing Ourselves
and Changing the Land

As I have already touched on at length, the
entirety of Buddhism exists within our own
lives. And the key to attaining Buddhahood—the
ultimate transformation of our life-state—also
lies in a change in our hearts, or minds.

To convey this point, Nichiren Daishonin
here summarizes a point from the Vimalakirti
Sutra:' “When one seeks the Buddhas’ emanci-
pation in the minds of ordinary beings, one

38

On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime

® o. ,!
é © ¢ e e @ ° ¢ e < © @ ‘7 ~, “,

finds that ordinary beings are the entities of
enlightenment, and that the sufferings of birth
and death are nirvana”? (WND-1, 4). ;
“Ordinary beings are the entities of enlight-
enment” means that the wisdom for attaining
Buddhahood (enlightenment) manifests in the
lives of ordinary people steeped in earthly
desires. Similarly, “the sufferings of birth and
death are nirvana” means that the Buddha life-
State of true peace and tranquillity (nirvana)
manifests in the lives of ordinary people tor
mented by the sufferings of birth and death.
Here, Nichiren explains that Buddhas and
ordinary people are not separated by an insur-
mountable divide; that the only thing setting
them apart is the difference in the “minds of
ordinary beings.”

Nichiren also cites the passage from the
Vimalakirti Sutra that explains the difference
between pure and impure lands. This passage—
which Nichiren summarizes as “If the minds of
living beings are impure, their land is also
impure, but if their minds are pure, so is their
land”*—clarifies that there are not two separate
lands; the only difference between pure and
impure lands is “the good or evil of our minds.”
The view shown here is one in which the pure
dand does not exist in some otherworldly realm
but in'the real world, and is achieved by people
changing themselves Inside. This is a dynamic
and practical view of the Pure land, based on
the idea of “to purify Buddha lands” expounded
in the Lotus Sutra (The Lotus Sutra and Its
Opening and Closing Sutras, p. 117),

ren is from the “Inquiring a

or fifth, chapter. This chapter describes the
exchange between Vimalakirti, an outstanding
Buddhist lay believer and practitioner of the
bodhisattva way who has fallen ill, and Manju-
shri, one of Shakyamuni’s leading disciples, who
is visiting him. When asked the cause of his
illness, Vimalakirti replies, “Because all living
beings are sick, therefore I am sick.”* This is a
well-known passage that succinctly reveals the
fundamental bodhisattva spirit of taking on
others’ sufferings as one’s own.

Vimalakirti goes on to say that bodhisattvas
choose to be born among living beings afflicted
by delusion and to share in the sufferings of
birth and death in order to instruct and guide
those living beings to enlightenment. More-
over, bodhisattvas are never overwhelmed or
swayed by suffering, because they have estab-
lished a pure state of enlightenment within.’

Thus, the passages from the Vimalakirti
Sutra cited by Nichiren clarify the meaning of
Buddhahood and the pure land from the stand-
point of a bodhisattva practitioner fighting
amid the realities of daily life. Nichiren, there-
fore, states in conclusion, “When deluded, one
is called an ordinary being, but when enlight-
ened, one is called a Buddha” (WND-1, 4). In
other words, the difference between ordinary
people and Buddhas is nothing more than the
difference between delusion and enlightenment
in ordinary people’s minds. How, then, can we
transform delusion into enlightenment?

In the preceding passage, Nichiren explains
that when people’s hearts change, the land or
their external environment can also change. At
its foundation is a transformation from delu-
sion to enlightenment.

As discussed earlier, what makes this trans-
formation possible is the practice of chanting

Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and, on a spiritual
level, faith. Simply put, through faith we can
overcome the ignorance or darkness that is the
root of delusion and manifest the Buddhahood
with which we are originally endowed.

Here, Nichiren uses an analogy to describe
this fundamental potential for change, saying,
“This is similar to a tarnished mirror that will
shine like a jewel when polished” (WND-1, 4).
In this way, he conveys that the practice of
chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo—the means
for defeating our inner darkness—serves to
“polish” our lives.

All living beings are inherently entities of the
Mystic Law. And inherently, the life-state of Bud-
dhahood enables us to tap the limitless power of
the Mystic Law within us freely and without hin-
drance, whenever and in whatever form it is
needed. Nichiren likens this supreme state of life
to a clear mirror that shines like a jewel. Yet even
though we are an entity of the Mystic Law, we
cannot bring forth the power of that Law if our
lives are shrouded in ignorance. In such a
benighted state, we are like a “tarnished mirror”
that will not reflect anything. Chanting Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo is the practice for polishing
the tarnished mirror of our lives.

The Path for Polishing Our Lives:
(1) Brave Challenge

Nichiren Daishonin says with regard to chant-
ing as a practice for polishing our lives: “A mind
now clouded by the illusions of the innate dark-
ness of life is like a tarnished mirror, but when
polished, it is sure to become like a clear mirror,
reflecting the essential nature of phenomena
lie, the Dharma nature] and the true aspect of
