"If You Think the Law Is Outside Yourself,
You Are Not Embracing the Mystic Law"

Even though you chant and believe in Myoho-renge-kyo, if you think the Law
is outside yourself, you are embracing not the Mystic Law but an inferior
teaching. "Inferior teaching" means those [Buddhist teachings] other than this
[Lotus] sutra, which are all expedient and provisional. No expedient or provi-
sional teaching leads directly to enlightenment, and without the direct path to
enlightenment you cannot attain Buddhahood, even if you practice lifetime
after lifetime for countless kalpas. Attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime is
then impossible. Therefore, when you chant myoho and recite renge,1 you must
summon up deep faith that Myoho-renge-kyo is your life itself. ("On Attaining
Buddhahood in This Lifetime," The Writings of Nichiren Daishonin, vol. 1, p. 3)
