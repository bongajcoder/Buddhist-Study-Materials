If you chant Myoho-renge-kyo with deep faith in this principle [that the
entity of your life is in fact the entity of the Mystic Law], you are certain to
attain Buddhahood in this lifetime. That is why the sutra states, "After I have
passed into extinction, [one] should accept and uphold this sutra. Such a
person assuredly and without doubt will attain the Buddha way" [The Lotus
Sutra and Its Opening and Closing Sutras, p. 318]. Never doubt in the slightest.
Respectfully.
Maintain your faith and attain Buddhahood in this lifetime. Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo, Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.
