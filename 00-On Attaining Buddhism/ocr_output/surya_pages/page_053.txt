On Attaining
Buddhahood
In This Lifetime

The Mystic Nature of Our Lives-
"Become the Master of Your Mind
Rather Than Let Your Mind Master You"

What then does myo signify? It is simply the mysterious nature of our life from
moment to moment, which the mind cannot comprehend or words express.
When we look into our own mind at any moment, we perceive neither color
nor form to verify that it exists. Yet we still cannot say it does not exist, for
many differing thoughts continually occur. The mind cannot be considered
either to exist or not to exist. Life is indeed an elusive reality that transcends
both the words and concepts of existence and nonexistence. It is neither exis-
tence nor nonexistence, yet exhibits the qualities of both. It is the mystic entity
of the Middle Way that is the ultimate reality. Myo is the name given to the
mystic nature of life, and ho, to its manifestations [the manifestations of the
mind of myo]. Renge, which means lotus flower, is used to symbolize the
wonder of this Law. If we understand that our life at this moment is myo, then
we will also understand that our life at other moments is the Mystic Law. This
realization is the mystic kyo, or sutra. The Lotus Sutra is the king of sutras, the
direct path to enlightenment, for it explains that the entity of our life, which
manifests either good or evil at each moment, is in fact the entity of the
Mystic Law. ("On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime," The Writings of Nichiren Daishonin, vol. 1, p. 4)
