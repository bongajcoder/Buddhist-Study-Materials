. Asused here, “the Buddha's name” denotes Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.

Three meanings of myo: In “The Daimoku of the Lotus Sutra,”
Nichiren Daishonin writes: “Myo means to be fully endowed,
which in turn has the meaning of ‘perfect and full’ (WND-1, 146);
The character myo means to open” (WND-I, 145); and “Myo
means to revive, that is, to return to life” (WND-1, 149).

. The unchanging nature inherent in all things and phenomena.
. The ten directions refers to the entire universe, all physical space.

Specifically, the ten directions are the eight directions of the com-
pass—north, south, east, west, northwest, northeast, southeast and
southwest—plus up and down. Buddhist scriptures refer to the
existence of Buddha lands in all directions throughout the uni-
verse, each with its own Buddha. The expression the Buddhas of the
ten directions in the sutras indicates these Buddhas. The phrase ten
directions often appears with the phrase three existences, meaning
Past, present and future existences. “The Buddhas of the ten direc-
tions and three existences” thus means all Buddhas throughout
space and time.

. Substituting faith for wisdom: The principle that faith is the true

cause for gaining supreme wisdom, and faith alone leads to
enlightenment.

. Originally inherent mystic truth: The fundamental Law, Mystic

Law or Buddha nature with which all life is originally endowed.

. Various obstacles and hindrances to the practice of Buddhism that

appear as a result of one advancing correctly along the path of faith.

. Nichikan was the twenty-sixth chief priest of Taiseki-ji, the head

temple of the Nikko school (also known as the Fuji school). He is
revered as the restorer of Nichiren’s teachings because he worked to
clarify their true meaning, During the four centuries after Nichiren
Daishonin’s death, a number of errors and misconceptions had

arisen as his followers split into many schools. Nichikan worked
tirelessly to clarify the true meaning of Nichiren’s teachings. He
completed exegeses on Nichiren’s five major writings and other
works, and authored The Six- Volume Writings, which distinguishes
the correct interpretations of Nichiren’s teachings from misleading
ones.

10. The provisional teachings that preceded the Lotus Sutra do not
teach that the world of Buddhahood exists in all people, and
instead describe Buddhas as idealized and superior beings. The
Pure Land (Nembutsu) teachings, for example, explain that instead
of relying on one’s own efforts, one should exclusively depend on
salvation through such a Buddha—namely, Amida.

11. In “The Fourteen Slanders,” Nichiren writes: “There is a difference
if one chants the daimoku while acting against the intent of this
sutra ... Always remember that believers in the Lotus Sutra should
absolutely be the last to abuse one another. All those who keep faith
in the Lotus Sutra are most certainly Buddhas, and one who slan-
ders a Buddha commits a grave offense” (WND- I, 756).

12. In “The Heritage of the Ultimate Law of Life.” Nichiren writes: “All
disciples and lay supporters of Nichiren should chant Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo with the spirit of many in body but one in mind,
transcending all differences among themselves to become as insep-
arable as fish and the water in which they swim. This spiritual
bond is the basis for the universal transmission of the ultimate Law
of life and death. Herein lies the true goal of Nichiren’s propaga-
tion. When you are so united, even the great desire for widespread
propagation can be fulfilled” (WND-1I, 217).

13. In “The True Aspect of All Phenomena,” Nichiren writes: “At first
only Nichiren chanted Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, but then two,
three, and a hundred followed, chanting and teaching others. Prop-
agation will unfold this way in the future as well. Does this not
signify ‘emerging from the earth?” (WND-1, 385).
