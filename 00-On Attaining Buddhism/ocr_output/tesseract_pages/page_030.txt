Only by communing and fusing with the
power of other—which is eternal and transcends
our limited, finite selves—can we wholly activate
the power of self. At the same time, however, this
eternal, all-encompassing power of other actually
exists inherently in our lives. Nichiren writes:
“People are certainly selfempowered, and yet
they are not self-empowered . . . People are cer-
tainly other-empowered, and yet they are not
other-empowered” (“The Meaning of the Sacred
Teachings of the Buddha's Lifetime,” WND-2,
62)." What this means, I believe, is that by relying

neither exclusively on the power of other nor on

the power of self, we can manifest the power that

exists within us yet transcends our selves. Chant-

ing Nam-myoho-renge-kyo enables us to do this.

In this way, Nichiren Buddhism opens up a

broad new vision of a universal religion for the

happiness of all humankind—one that tran-
scends the approach of teachings that strictly
divide external power and the individual’s own

power and that emphasize one over the other.

Buddha In his writing “Happiness in This World,” Nichiren states:
“There is no true happiness for human beings other than chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. The [Lotus] sutra reads, “...where living
beings enjoy themselves at ease’ | The Lorus Sutra and Its Opening
and Closing Sutras, p. 272}. How could this passage mean anything
but the boundless joy of the Law?” (WND-1, 681),

definitions, into two major categories, those of meas-
of a small kalpa at approximately sixteen million years. According
to Buddhist cosmology, a world repeatedly undergoes four stages:
formation, continuance, decline and disintegration, Each of these
four stages lasts for twenty small kalpas and is equal to one medium
kalpa. Finally, one complete cycle forms a major kalpa.

The Ten Worlds are ten distinct realms or categories of beings
referred to in Buddhist scriptures, From the lowest to Padesiios
the realms of {1) hell, (2) hungry spirits, (3) animals, (4) asuras, (5)
human beings, (6) heavenly beings, (7) voice-hearers, (8) cause-
awakened ones, (9) bodhisattvas and (10) Buddhas. The Lotus
Sutra teaches that each of the Ten Worlds contains all ten within it,

making it possible to interpret them as potential states of life inher-
‘ent in each individual being.

“The nine worlds have the potential for Buddhahood and Buddha-
hood retains the nine worlds”; This means that that the lives of
beings in the nine worlds—the worlds from hell through to bodhi-
‘sattva—are endowed with the world of Buddhahood, and that the
lives of Buddhas are also endowed with the nine worlds. In other
words, ordinary people and Buddhas are essentially the same with
no distinction between them.

Three thousand realms in a single moment of life is a philosophical
system established by T’ien-t’ai. The “three thousand realms” indi-
cates the varying aspects and phases that life assumes at each
moment. At each moment, life manifests one of the Ten Worlds.
Each of these worlds possesses the potential for all ten within itself,
thus making one hundred possible worlds. Each of these hundred
worlds possesses the ten factors and operates within each of the
three realms of existence, thus making three thousand realms.

10.Nichiren Daishonin writes: “A bird’s egg contains nothing but liq-

uid, yet by itself this develops into a beak, two eyes, and all the
other parts, and the bird soars into the sky. We, too, are the eggs of
ignorance, which are pitiful things, but when nurtured by the
chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, which is like the warmth of
the mother bird, we develop the beak of the thirty-two features
and the feathers of the eighty characteristics [of the Buddha] and
are free to soar into the sky of the true aspect of all phenomena
and the reality of all things” (“Letter to Nike,” WND-1, 1030).

1LNichiren Daishonin states: “Now in the teachings of the Lotus

Sutra, people are certainly self-empowered, and yet they are not
self-empowered, This is because one’s own self, or life, at the same
time possesses the nature of all living beings in the Ten Worlds.
Therefore this self has from the beginning been in the possession of
one’s own realm of Buddhahood and of the realms of Buddhahood
possessed by all other living beings. Therefore when one attains
Buddhahood one does not take on some new or ‘other’ Buddha

“Again, in the teachings of the Lotus Sutra, people are certainly
other-empowered, and yet they are not other-empowered. The
Buddhas, who are considered separate from us, are actually con-
tained within our own selves, or the lives of us ordinary people.
Those Buddhas manifest the realms of Buddhahood of all living
beings in the same manner as we do” (“The Sacred Teachings of the
Buddha's Lifetime,’ WND-2, 62).
