of myo illuminated by the essential nature of phe-
nomena and the true aspect of reality.

If we follow the deluded minds of ordinary
people—minds that tend to be weak and easily
swayed—our inner potential can rapidly wither
Or, €ven worse, we may succumb to negative and
destructive impulses. This is a problem stemming
from the subtlety of the mind. Because our minds
are the key to attaining Buddhahood in this
lifetime, we must overcome our own inner weak-
nesses. This is what our Buddhist practice is all
about. The deluded minds of ordinary people are
constantly wavering. We must not make such
wavering minds our basis or guide.

Nichiren Daishonin emphasizes this by citing
the well-known passage “Become the master of
your mind rather than let your mind master you”
(“Letter to the Brothers,” WND-1, 502). This pas-
to the effect: “Our minds may suddenly Tun out of
control. Therefore, we must tame them like a wild
elephant, not allowing our minds to become our
masters, but rather seeking to master our minds”4
The Nirvana Sutra contains a similar Passage,
“May I be the master of my mind and not let my
mind become my master!” (“Letter to Renjo,”
WND-2, 5). Nichiren cites this admonition many
times, making it a guideline for his followers.

Becoming the master of one’s mind means
having a sound compass in life and the bright
beacon of faith. We must not be mastered by ordi-
nary people’s inconstant, weak and ever-changing
minds of delusion. To master our minds, we must
guide them in the right direction. In that sense,
the true master of the mind is the Law and the
teachings of the Buddha. Shakyamuni vowed to
make the Law to which he had become enlight-
ened the master of his mind, and he took pride in

living true to that vow. This is the way of life of
“taking refuge in the Law” that Shakyamuni
emphasized in his final injunction to his disciples
before he died.s

The priests of the various Buddhist schools
during Nichiren’s lifetime had forgotten this
spirit of Shakyamuni. Following their own arbi-
trary minds or thinking, they lost sight of the
Buddha's teachings, denigrated the Lotus Sutra
and succumbed to arrogance. By contrast, Nichi-
ren taught that the true master of the mind is
Myoho-renge-kyo—the heart of the Lotus Sutra
and the fundamental Law of all Buddhas—and
set forth the concrete Practice of chanting Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo for mastering one’s mind. Also,
he frequently stressed to his followers the impor-
tant spirit of faith to seek this true master of the
mind—the Mystic Law.

For example, when, on account of his faith, the
elder of the Ikegami brothers‘ was disowned by
their father, Nichiren encouraged the two brothers,
saying that this was Precisely the time for them,
based on faith, to unite and overcome the situa-
tion. He offers them this guidance: “A Passage in

you. Whatever trouble Occurs, regard it as no more

es a dream, and think only of the Lotus Sutra”
(“Letter to the Brothers,” WND-1, 502)
