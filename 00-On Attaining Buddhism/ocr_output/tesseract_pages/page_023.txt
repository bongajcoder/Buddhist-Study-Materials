Key Points

Uncovering People’s Inner Potential
The point where Buddhism radically departs from
many other philosophies and religions is that it
uncovered within the individual’s own life the Law,
or limitless inner power, for resolving all suffering
on the most essential level. A Buddha is one who,
based on this Law, has attained the ultimate wis-
dom to fundamentally put an end to suffering and
construct indestructible happiness. Buddhism is a
teaching of unparalleled humanism that stresses
the boundless potential within human beings.
That’s why it is called the “internal way.” (p. 13)

The Mystic Truth of Life
and the Universe

The cosmic life enfolds and pervades everything,
and because it does so, it is also inherent in all
things. The oneness of the cosmic life and our indi-
vidual lives lies at the heart of the “principle of the
mutually inclusive relationship of a single moment
of life and all phenomena.” To awaken to this mys-
tic truth is to attain the Buddha’s “unsurpassed
enlightenment.” (p. 14)

The Meaning of Chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo
Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo enables each per-
son to actualize a way of life based on the universal
truth of Myoho-renge-kyo. The crucial point in
chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo in Nichiren
Buddhism is not simply intoning the name of an
external truth. It constitutes a practice to actually
summon forth the inner truth that pervades the
universe and our own selves and live our lives in
accord with that truth. This practice could be
described as a process of establishing a self capable
of activating and tapping from within the “mystic
truth originally inherent in all living beings.” (p. 16)

Establishing a Buddhism of the People
Nichiren established the means by which all people
can awaken to the truth of life and the universe
within their own lives and actively manifest that
truth, Moreover, this truth is the enlightened

wisdom of all Buddhas and is revealed in the Lotus
Sutra, which is the highest teaching of Buddhism.
By basing ourselves on that truth, we can lead lives
of supreme value. Nichiren Buddhism made this
realm of truth accessible to anyone, anywhere, any-
time, no matter what his or her background. It
would be no exaggeration to say that the practice
of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo in Nichiren
Buddhism gave rise to a Buddhism of the people.
This practice of chanting is indeed the supreme
Buddhist practice, making it possible for us to fun-
damentally transform our lives. (p. 17)

The Direct Path to

Manifesting Buddhahood
To chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is to summon
forth our own innate Buddhahood. It is the direct
path to manifesting that highest state of life. The
wisdom and compassion of a Buddha that emerges
through chanting enriches our life-condition, and
brings happiness to ourselves and others. Further,
as more and more people come to chant Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo for the happiness of themselves
and others, it will be possible to forge an alliance
of people filled with the compassion of a Buddha
and to ultimately transform even the destiny of
humankind. (p. 17)

Causing the Sun of
Buddhahood To Rise Within

As Nichiren indicates when he says that the Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo he chants for the happiness of self
and others toward the realization of kosen-rufu
clears “the clouds of ignorance” (see “The Doctrine
of the Three Thousand Realms,” WND-2, 85), Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo truly has the power to dispel life’s
darkness. When we chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo,
the sun of Buddhahood rises in our hearts. The igno-
rance and delusion, like heavy clouds shrouding the
sun, are swept away. When the sun of Buddhahood
comes to shine within us, the darkness of ignorance
vanishes, But Nichiren Buddhism is not a teaching
in which Nichiren alone shines like the sun. It is a
teaching in which all of us can bring the sun of
Buddhahood to rise in our lives just as he did. We are
truly fortunate in that we can manifest the same bril-
liant life-state of Buddhahood as Nichiren. (p. 18)
