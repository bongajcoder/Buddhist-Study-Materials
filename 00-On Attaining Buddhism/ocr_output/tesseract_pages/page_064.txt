In his treatise “The Three Great Secret

Laws,” Nichiren Daishonin notes that, in the
Middle Day of the Law, Tien-t’ai and his
teacher Nan-Yiieh both chanted the daimoku
of the Lotus Sutra, but they did so merely as a
private practice and did not teach it to others.
Nichiren clarifies that, in contrast, he not only
chants it himself but teaches this practice to
others.’

Also, in “The Object of Devotion for
Mind,” Nichiren refers to the

practice” here means chanting Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo in terms of both faith and practice,*

The actual practice of daimoku of the
Bodhisattvas of the Earth in the Latter Day of
the Law means chanting Nam-myoho-renge-
kyo for the enlightenment of all people—a
practice aiming for the happiness of both
oneself and others. As Nichiren indicates
when he says “At first only Nichiren chanted
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, but then two, three,
and a hundred followed,” the essence of this
practice is chanting it ourselves and also
