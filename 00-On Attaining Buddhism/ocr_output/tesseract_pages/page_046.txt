se ee preceding passage, Nichiren explains
ae when people’s hearts change, the land or
t eir external environment can also change. At
ts foundation is a transformation from delu-
sion to enlightenment.
As discussed earlier, what makes this trans-
formation possible is the practice of chanting

Pete ec ae and, on a spiritual

overcome the ignorance or darkness that is the
root of delusion and manifest the Buddhahood
with which we are originally endowed.

Here, Nichiren uses an analogy to describe
this fundamental potential for change, saying,
“This is similar to a tarnished mirror that will
shine like a jewel when polished” (WND-1I, 4)-
In this way, he conveys that the practice of
chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo—the means
for defeating our inner darkness—serves to
“polish” our lives.

All living beings are inherently entities of the
Mystic Law. And inherently, the life-state of Bud-
dhahood enables us to tap the limitless power of
the Mystic Law within us freely and without hin-
drance, whenever and in whatever form it is
needed. Nichiren likens this supreme state of life
to a clear mirror that shines like a jewel. Yet even
though we are an entity of the Mystic Law, we
cannot bring forth the power of that Law if our
lives are shrouded in ignorance-
benighted state, we are like a “tarnished mirror”
that will not reflect anything. Chanting Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo is the practice for polishing
the tarnished mirror of our lives.
