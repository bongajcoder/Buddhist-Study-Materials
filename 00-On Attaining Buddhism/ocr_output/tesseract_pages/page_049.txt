On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime

self-satisfied. Rather than being someone who is
strong in adversity but weak when things are
going well, we should seek to construct the kind
of invincible faith that allows us to “regard both
suffering and joy as facts of life” (WND-1, 681).
Such strong faith is forged through our prac-
tice as Soka Gakkai members striving to achieve
the lofty goal of kosen-rufu and our own enlight-
enment in this existence. Above all, chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo—the process by which
we “diligently polish our mirror day and night”
(see WND-1, 4)—strengthens our lives in the
same way that a magnificent sword is forged and
tempered. The crux here lies in chanting with the
spirit to challenge in times of suffering, and
chanting with appreciation in times of joy.
“Continuing” is another way of saying “not
regressing.” Throughout the pages of Nichiren’s
writings, we can see his emphasis on never
regressing or backsliding in faith. To cite but a
few passages, Nichiren writes: “One . . . who
chants the daimoku, is the Thus Come One’s
emissary. Also, one who perseveres through
great persecutions and embraces the sutra from
beginning to end is the Thus Come One’s emis-
sary” (“The Farther the Source, the Longer the
Stream,” WND-1, 942); “Strengthen your faith
day by day and month after month. Should you
slacken in your resolve even a bit, devils will
take advantage” (“On Persecution Befalling the
Sage,” WND-1, 997); and “Carry through with
your faith in the Lotus Sutra. You cannot strike
fire from flint if you stop halfway” (“Earthly
Desires Are Enlightenment,” WND-1, 319).
Without a battle to conquer ignorance or
darkness, we cannot manifest the essential
nature of phenomena, or Dharma nature, And
unless we continue to wage this battle through
exerting ourselves in faith, we cannot construct

an unshakable state of life that is one with the
Dharma nature (namely, the life-state of Bud-
dhahood). This is because if we “slacken in our
resolve even a bit” (see WND-1, 997), as Nichi-
ren writes, we will become vulnerable to life’s
negative influences.

Also, when we exert ourselves in faith, the
three obstacles and four devils inevitably arise.
It is by defeating them that we can establish the
life-state of Buddhahood. When we polish our
lives on the most fundamental level through
the practice of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-
kyo, we can deepen, strengthen and broaden
ourselves spiritually without limit.

“Nam-myoho-renge-kyo
Is a Diligent Practice”

Nichiren Daishonin strove to share the supreme
inner state of attaining Buddhahood in this
lifetime with all his followers—and indeed all
humankind.

The true greatness of the practice of chant-
ing Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is that it enables
each person to actually manifest the same
life-state as the Buddha and lead an existence
of unsurpassed depth and meaning. This is
clearly indicated in the following well-known
passage from The Record of the Orally Transmit-
ted Teachings: “If in a single moment of life we
exhaust the pains and trials of millions of
Kalpas, then instant after instant there will arise
in us the three Buddha bodies? with which we
are eternally endowed, Nam-myoho-renge-kyo
is just such a ‘diligent’ practice” (p. 214),
