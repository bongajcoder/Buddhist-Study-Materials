the great treasure storehouse that brings good
fortune and happiness to all. The important thing
is to live out our lives based on and completely in
sync with the Law; it is to imbue and solidify our
lives with the Mystic Law.

Our daily realities are filled with an endless
succession of problems, But with the firm belief
that our lives are Myoho-renge-kyo, we should
Strive to boldly challenge everything with the
unwavering conviction that we can overcome all
hardships and become happy without fail. When
we maintain deep faith based on the foundation
that “I am Myoho-renge-kyo? we can take on any
Problem with courage. The key to victory in life
lies in whether we can bring forth courage. Not a
shrinking timidity but a challenging courage—

Irrespective of the obstacles we May encounter
in the course of our Practice, we must not retreat
a single step. We must not be alarmed or startled
by them. The power of the Mystic Law (Myoho-

Fearing hardships and bemoaning and resent-

our ability to overcome our circumstances and
turning to others in the hope that they will save
us, or blaming others for our problems, or giving
in to hopelessness and resignation.

When difficulties beset us, no matter how try-
ing they may be, we must clearly see them for the
obstacles or devilish functions they are and battle
against them without retreating. This is the way
of life of those who chant Nam -myoho-renge-kyo
and dedicate their lives to the Mystic Law.
