WND-1, 4). Indeed, we find Nichiren stressing
the importance of faith throughout “On
Attaining Buddhahood in this Lifetime.” For
instance, he writes: “Summon up deep faith”
(WND-1, 3), and “Arouse deep faith” (WND-1,
4). He teaches that deepening our faith is the
royal road to achieving enlightenment.

The key to our enlightenment as ordinary
people ultimately depends on how deeply we
can believe this truth—that, by manifesting the
Mystic Law inherent within our lives, we can
definitely attain Buddhahood.

The kind of faith needed for attaining Buddha-

the hallmark of Bodhisattvas of the Earth.’

“After I have passed into extinction, [one]

as scriptural evidence of gaining enlighten-

read this passage to mean that the thoroughly

On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime

precisely the faith required for attaining Bud-
dhahood in this lifetime.

In the “Supernatural Powers” chapter,
Shakyamuni Buddha transfers the essence of
the Lotus Sutra’ to Bodhisattva Superior Prac-
tices and the other Bodhisattvas of the Earth.
He then outlines how these bodhisattvas
should exert themselves in propagating the
sutra after his passing. The above passage
cited by Nichiren at the end of “On Attaining
Buddhahood in This Lifetime” is the conclud-
ing part of Shakyamuni’s description of
benefits to be gained as a result of those
efforts. Here, “[one] should accept and
uphold this sutra” means accepting and
upholding the daimoku of the Lotus Sutra,
Myoho-renge-kyo—the essence of the teach-
ing transmitted by the Buddha to Bodhisattva
Superior Practices.

In “The True Aspect of All Phenomena,”
Nichiren writes, “Were they not Bodhisattvas of
the Earth, they could not chant the daimoku”
(WND-1, 385). What is it that makes the chant-
ing of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo so difficult then?
Viewed from one perspective, it is because
breaking through fundamental darkness and
triumphing over devilish functions requires us
to chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo with strong,
thoroughly forged faith.

Chanting and Teaching Others
To Do the Same

Further, the true significance of the Bodhi-
sattvas of the Earth’s practice of chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo lies in their not only
carrying out this practice themselves but teach-
ing others to do the same. In other words, it is
a practice for both self and others,
