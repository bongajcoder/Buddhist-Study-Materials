Viewed from the Buddhist perspective,
Mr. Toda dedicated his life to demonstrating
the state of Buddhahood of one who follows
the highest human path. As his true, direct dis-
ciple, I proudly proclaim the great victory of
my mentor’s human revolution.

Overflowing With Life Force,
Fulfilling Our Mission

But past what is attaining Buddhahood? In
discussing this question, President Toda con-
stantly declared it meant securing eternal
happiness. “Attaining Buddhahood,” he said,
ae achieving a state of being that allows us
always be reborn overflowing with powerful
; € force, to fulfill our mission to our heart's

ontent, to achieve all our goals and to possess
good fortune that no one can destroy.” These
“a words of true philosophy that get at the

on of attaining Buddhahood in language
that is simple and straightforward.

Mr. Toda continued, “And is it not greater
still if we can enjoy tens, hundreds, thousands,
tens of millions of existences in this way?” I can
still hear his voice ringing in my ears, filled with
indomitable confidence and conviction like the
mighty roar of a lion king.

Those who have dedicated themselves to the
Mystic Law will, on each successive rebirth,
overflow with vibrant life force, accomplish
a mission for kosen-rufu that only they can
achieve and enjoy immense, indestructible
good fortune. They can joyfully savor such lives
again and again.

Attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime, one
could say, allows us to solidly enter this eternal
path, Countless Soka Gakkai members have

done so. As long as actual proof of the Mystic
Law continues to blossom brilliantly in each
person’s life, the faith of the Soka Gakkai will
shine eternally. Mr. Toda declared that the life of
each Soka Gakkai member would be recorded
in future sutras as “Soka Gakkai Buddha.”

Of course, each aspect of birth, aging, sick-
ness and death is part of the reality of our lives
in this world. Our physical bodies cannot
escape the changes found in the cycle of forma-
tion, continuance, decline and disintegration to
which all phenomena in the universe are sub-
ject. Naturally, our bodies deteriorate as we
age. If practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism
were to retain youthful bodies forever, it would
go against the laws of nature! As we thoroughly
polish ourselves through faith, however, the
inner essence of our lives will never decay.

I hope that all our pioneering and senior
members who have dedicated themselves to
kosen-rufu with such sincerity over the years
will cheerfully, proudly adorn the final chapter
of their lives with noble victory, confident of
this point. Please continue to strive with the
spirit of fresh challenge! Looking at Nichiren’s
writings, there is absolutely no doubt that those
who forge such a fighting spirit in this existence
do attain the lofty spiritual state allowing them
to make their way freely, joyfully, through the
journey of eternal life.

In describing this free, untrammeled state
of life that continues across eternity and
encompasses the entire universe, Mr. Toda
would often say humorously: “We die, but we
are reborn. For my part, I would like to come
back as a stunning beauty!” He would then go
on to joke that this beauty would be famous
around the world, with people flocking to buy
her photos and get her autograph. Of course,
