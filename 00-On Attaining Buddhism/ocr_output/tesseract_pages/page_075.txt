The Essence of Chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo
The Law contained in the practice of chanting
spread by Nichiren is truly wondrous, But even the
power of this wondrous Law cannot fully manifest
in a life clouded by ignorance. Ignorance is the
inner darkness that prevents us from believing in
the Mystic Law and staying focused on our own
Buddha nature and that of others. The practice of
chanting enables us to break through this darkness
and — bring ‘forth our Buddhahood. Bat-

On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime

Confident and Concrete Prayer

The erroneous belief that Myoho-renge-kyo (the
Mystic Law) exists outside of our lives has at its
core an inability to believe that all people—our-
selves and others—possess the Buddha nature.
And this disbelief stems from fundamental dark-
ness. In terms of attitude in faith, this tendency to
skeptically regard the Buddha nature as “a nice
ideal but one that doesn’t really change reality” will
manifest itself as prayer that is vague and lacking in
conviction. If our efforts in faith are halfhearted,
we cannot change our attitude or fundamentally
transform our lives. As Nichiren indicates in this
writing when he says, “You must summon up deep
faith” (WND-1, 3), if we hope to make our inher-
ent Buddha nature the basis of our lives—or as
Nichiren terms it, to attain Buddhahood in this
lifetime—we must continue striving to deepen our
faith, our conviction in chanting Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo. And as our faith deepens, it will
manifest as confident and concrete prayer. (p. 43)

Overcoming Grumbling
and Complaining

Grumbling and complaining are the principal
gateways to ambiguous, elusive doubt and disbe-
lief. Even if we know it is wrong, we may find
ourselves grumbling and complaining in spite of
ourselves. Should such behavior become habitual,
it will act as a constant brake on our growth and
cause us to forget about advancing and improving
ourselves, We will then effectively close off our own
potential, falling into the path of seeking the Law
outside of us. While it might be a real challenge to
stop grumbling and complaining, we can derive
from the Mystic Law the wisdom to control these
tendencies and use them as a springboard for pos-
itive growth and development. (p. 32)
