seal by day, through consistently chanting
-myoho-renge-kyo, we can accumulate the
causes and effects for attaining Buddhahood that
make it possible to transform a mind clouded by
the innate darkness of life into a mind reflecting
the essential nature of phenomena and the true
aspect of reality (see WND-1, 4). The virtues of
these causes and effects over time become the

bone and marrow of our beings, with flowers of
benefit blossoming in our characters and in our
lives. This is the mystic kyo in terms of our indi-
vidual lives.

Also, we can regard this mystic kyo as the
spread of the Mystic Law from ourselves to
others. When “the mind at this moment” is
understood to mean the Buddha’s mind and “the
mind at other moments” is taken to mean the
minds of all living beings, then kyo refers to the
Buddha’s teachings that expound aspects of his
enlightenment regarding the mystic nature of
life, or the mind of myo. And the king of sutras
that directly elucidates the mind of myo itself is
the Lotus Sutra, the essence of which is Myoho-
renge-kyo. In that sense, the development of
kosen-rufu, with people propagating the Mystic
Law and chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo
unstintingly for their own happiness and that of
others and teaching others to do the same, could
be said to correspond to the mystic kyo.

As seen in the aforementioned discussion,
Myoho-renge-kyo is the Law inherent in our own
lives. The ongoing moment-to-moment transfor-
mation in our hearts and minds that we achieve
through chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo not
only leads to a fundamental inner change but to a
change in the entire way we live our lives, putting
us on track to attain Buddhahood in this lifetime.
And it further creates a groundswell for the great
transformation of all humankind that is kosen-
rufu. The dynamic force for change on all levels is
Myoho-renge-kyo.

Becoming the Masters of Our Minds

Since Myoho-renge-kyo is the Law inherent within

- our lives, there is another topic I must touch on.

Namely, the relation between the mind of delu-
sion clouded by innate darkness and the mind
