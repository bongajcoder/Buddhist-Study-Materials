present form as explained in the Lotus Sutra. And
Nichiren Daishonin reveals how to actualize this
profound teaching.

Drawing an analogy to rice crops, Nichiren
notes that while some ripen early and some ripen
late, they will all mature and be ready for harvest
within the year. He explains that votaries of the
Lotus Sutra will likewise attain Buddhahood in
this existence without fail.5

Nichiren places importance on the present
lifetime of human beings. Of course, not only
humans but also all living beings possess the
Buddha nature and have the potential to attain
Buddhahood in their present form, but Nichiren’s
focus is always first and foremost on the happi-
ness of human beings.

The human heart is sensitive, multifaceted
and rich; it has the capacity for magnificent
achievement. For that very reason, the heart often
undergoes great suffering and torment, and can
become trapped in an endless, downward spiral.

Will we transmigrate forever along the paths of
evil, or can we succeed in directing our lives into
an orbit of good?

As evidenced in many of his writings,
Nichiren repeatedly stresses the crucial impor-
tance of the heart, or mind. In this inner realm of
life, the potential resides for dramatic shifts from
evil to good or from good to evil. That is why
Nichiren’s teaching of enlightenment can be
viewed as a process that begins with inner change.
In other words, through the power of faith, we
can defeat the negative functions inside us that
are governed by the fundamental darkness in all
human hearts and manifest the positive functions
of life that are one with the Dharma nature—our
Buddhahood.

This present lifetime, in which we have been
born as human beings, represents a golden
opportunity to ensure that our lives no longer
transmigrate along the evil paths but instead
traverse the paths of good.
