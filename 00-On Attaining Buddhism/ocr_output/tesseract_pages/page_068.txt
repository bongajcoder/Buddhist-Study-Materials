“ in the slightest . . . Maintain your faith
attain Buddhahood in this lifetime”
(WND-1, 4). Faith is absolutely essential.
ee to return to the opening of this writing,
ichiren talks of freeing ourselves from the
sufferings of birth and death we have endured
Since time without beginning and attaining
without fail unsurpassed enlightenment in this
lifetime (see WND-1, 3). The purpose of our
Present existence is to cut the chains of suffering

we have endured from the beginningless past
and establish the eternal state of Buddhahood.
By challenging ourselves with all our hearts so
as to have no regrets in this lifetime, we can
forge a state of life victorious and free of
regret throughout eternity.

I know

the wonder of

supreme happiness

and the brilliant victory

of a great life.

I composed this poem at the start of 2006
with the wish that all SGI members will lead
tremendously fulfilling lives. May each of you
make your way triumphantly along the path of
attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime, enjoy-
ing this “supreme happiness” and the “brilliant
victory of a great life.”

Let us resolutely win in the struggle to
attain Buddhahood in this lifetime, which con-
denses eternity into this present moment, and
let us joyfully continue our journey of kosen-
rufu together across eternity.

1. Bodhisattvas of the Earth: Disciples of Shakyamuni from the remote
ren whom he calls forth in the “Emerging from the Earth” chapter of
Lotus Sutra and entrusts with propagating the Lotus Sutra after his
Passing. They are known as Bodhisattvas of the Earth for they appear

A from the earth. Their leader is called Superior Practices.

. Transfer of the essence of the Lotus Sutra; In the “Supernatural
Powers” chapter of the Lotus Sutra, Shakyamuni entrusts the sutra’s
teaching to Bodhisattva Superior Practices and the other iss
of the Earth. This is called the “transfer of the essence” because
Shakyamuni describes the sutra as containing: 1) “all the doctrines
possessed by the Thus Come One”; 2) “all the freely exercised super-
natural powers of the Thus Come One”; 3) “the storehouse of all the
secret essentials of the Thus Come One”; and 4) “all the most profound
matters of the Thus Come One,” adding that “all these are proclaimed,
revealed, and clearly expounded in this sutra” (LSOC, 316).

3. Nichiren writes, “Now, however, we have entered the Latter Day of the
Law, and the daimoku that I, Nichiren, chant is different from that of
earlier ages. This Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. encompasses both practice
for oneself and the teaching of others” (“On the Receiving of the Three
Great Serre’ Laress Waites 10 (Nam-myoho-renge-kyo) has

7 daimoku of the esse! teac! ‘am-ny renge- ‘

‘ ke aspects: the daimoku of faith and the daimoku of practice. The

former means to believe in the Gohonzon, the latter to chant Nam-

myoho- renge-kyo and spread it.

5, Six difficult and nine easy acts: The “Treasure Tower” chapter of the
Lotus Sutra explains from six perspectives the difficulty of practicing
the Lotus Sutra after Shakyamuni’s passing. By contrast, it describes
nine seemingly impossible actions, such as throwing Mount Sumeru
into another world system, 2s comparatively easy (see LSOC 218-19).

6. Three powerful enemies: The verse section of the “Encouraging
Devotion™ chapter of the Lotus Sutra describes the people who will
persecute a person who spreads the Lotus Sutra in the evil age after
Shakyamuni's passing. In his Annotations on “The Words and Phrases
of the Lotus Sutra,” Miao-lo describes these people as belonging to
three categories: arrogant lay people, arrogant monks and nuns, and
arrogant false sages (see LSOC, 233-34),

7. Lessening karmic retribution; The principle that one can experience
the etfects of bad karma from the past to a lesser degree because of
Buddhist faith and practice.

8 The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings says: “The lion’s roar
(shishi ku) is the preaching of the Buddha. The preaching of the Law
means the penhinn of La yee or acre?
myoho- kyo in parti The first shi o! ishi, or ‘lion’
[which means ‘teacher’, is the Wonderful Law that is passed on by the
teacher. The second shi [which means ‘child’] is the Wonderful Law as it
is received by the disciples. The ‘roar’ [of the term ‘lion’s roar’) is the
sound of the teacher and the disciples chanting in unison” (OTT, 111).
