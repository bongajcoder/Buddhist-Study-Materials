1. Nagarjuna: A Mahayana scholar of southern India, thought to have
lived between the years 150 and 250, who is especially known for his
systematization of the doctrine of nonsubstantiality, Nonsubstantial-
ity is the concept that things and phenomena have no fixed or
independent nature or existence of their own, Nagarjuna integrated
the practical doctrine of the Middle Way, transcending both asceti-
cism and hedonism, and the concept of dependent origination into
the doctrine of nonsubstantiality. In other words, by viewing all things

Not as entities with an eternally fixed nature but as always assuming

a temporary and changing aspect through their relation to other

things (i.e., dependent origination), one can act based on a trae per-

ception of reality, without either attachment or fixed prejudices (i.e.,

the Middle Way).

2. Unification of the three truths: Rased on the section in Nagarjuna’s
Treatise on the Middle Way that integrates the concepts of nonsubstan-
tiality, dependent origination and the Middle Way, the Great Teacher
Tien-t'ai established the doctrine of the three truths: the truth of
nonsubstantiality, the truth of temporary existence and the truth of
the Middle Way. Further, he clarified that these truths, rather than
being separate and independent of one another, are three ways of
viewing any particular thing or entity, and that the three moreover
constitute an integral whole, each possessing all three within itself.
This is called the unification of the three truths.

. Threefold contemplation in a single mind: A method of meditation
formulated by Tien-t'ai to enable people to perceive the unification of
the three truths of nonsubstantiality, temporary existence and the
Middle Way. While the concept of the unification of the three truths

6, Tkegami brothers: Leading disciples of Nichiren Daishonin, The elder
brother, Munenaka, was twice disowned by the father, a follower of
Ryokan. At the same time, the father tempted Munenaga, the younger
brother, to abandon his faith and take his brother's place as the next
head of the family. Despite these adversities, the brothers persevered in
faith. The father rescinded Munenaka’s disinheritance and in the end
took faith in Nichiren’s teachings.
