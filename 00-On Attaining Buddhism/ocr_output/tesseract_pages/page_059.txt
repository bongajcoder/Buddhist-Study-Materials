2. Unification of the three truths: Rased on the section in Nagarjuna’s
Treatise on the Middle Way that integrates the concepts of nonsubstan-
tiality, dependent origination and the Middle Way, the Great Teacher
Tien-t'ai established the doctrine of the three truths: the truth of

brother, Munenaka, was twice disowned by the father, a follower of
Ryokan. At the same time, the father tempted Munenaga, the younger

faith. The father rescinded Munenaka’s disinheritance and in the end
took faith in Nichiren’s teachings.
