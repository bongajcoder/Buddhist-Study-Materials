Mystic Law, we can reveal our Buddhahood in this
lifetime. Nichiren writes: “The Lotus Sutra is the
king of sutras, the direct path to enlightenment, for
it explains that the entity of our life (literally, our
mind or inner reality], which manifests either good
or evil at each moment, is in fact the entity of the
Mystic Law. If you chant Myoho-renge-kyo with
deep faith in this principle, you are certain to attain
Buddhahood in this lifetime” (WND-1, 4).

A Teaching of Genuine Humanism

Next, [ll touch on the significance of Nichiren
Daishonin’s teaching of attaining Buddhahood in
this lifetime from three perspectives.

Pll start by pointing out that through opening
the way for all people to attain Buddhahood in
this lifetime through chanting Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo, Nichiren established for the first time
a teaching of genuine humanism. Opening the
way to enlightenment for all people could be
called the prerequisite for a genuinely humanistic
religion. This, I believe, is the religious or philo-
sophical significance of the principle of attaining
Buddhahood in this lifetime.

Nichiren had deep insight into the potential
of human beings, discerning that they could free
themselves from a cycle of negative transmigra-
tion and realize a positive one through profound
inner change. And he set forth a practical way to
enable all people to achieve this. Consequently,
there is no other teaching that can more
deservedly be called humanistic than Nichiren
Buddhism,

In “The True Aspect of All Phenomena,”
Nichiren writes: “Though it is thought that
Shakyamuni Buddha possesses the three virtues
of sovereign, teacher, and parent for the sake

of all of us living beings, that is not so. On the
contrary, it is common mortals who endow him
with the three virtues” (WND-1, 384). This pas-
sage describes a shift from an authoritarian to a
humanistic, people-centered religion.’ The
teaching of Nichiren, who established the con-
crete means for achieving enlightenment in this
lifetime, makes this shift possible.

When the Soka Gakkai’s first president,
Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, formulated his theory of
value, he did not include the aspects of “holiness”
or “sacredness,” which many thinkers before him
had considered to constitute religious value. For
Mr. Makiguchi, “great good” was deemed the high-
est value a religion should strive to realize. By “great
good,” he is referring to the highest value that can
be actualized by human beings and society. In
Mr. Makiguchi’s theory of value, we find the view
that a true religion is one that serves the welfare of
human beings. Nichiren’s opening of the path to
attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime signifies
the establishment of a religion that contributes
to the happiness of human beings in the greatest
possible way.

The Significance of Attaining
Buddhahood for Our Lives

Second, by opening the path to attaining Buddha-
hood in this lifetime, Nichiren Daishonin made it
possible for us to lead lives based on the infinite
power of the Mystic Law—that is, to lead solid
and secure lives that give us the courage and con-
fidence to be self-reliant. This is the significance
of the principle of attaining Buddhahood in this
lifetime in terms of our individual lives.

In Nichiren Buddhism, attaining enlightenment
is not about embarking on some inconceivably long
