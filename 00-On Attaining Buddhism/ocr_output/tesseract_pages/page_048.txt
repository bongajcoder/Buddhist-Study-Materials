The Path for Polishing Our Lives:
(2) Continuing

Next, continuing is vital. It is absolutely essential
for attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime.
Nichiren Daishonin says: “To accept is easy; to
continue is difficult. But Buddhahood lies in
continuing faith” (“The Difficulty of Sustaining
Faith” WND-1, 471). In “On Attaining Buddha-
hood in This Lifetime,” we see the paramount
Importance of continuing from Nichiren’s
Ppeated emphasis on the need to practice “day
Be night” and “diligently” (WND-1, 4). Main-
aining an unflagging practice of chanting

Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is a crucial requirement
for attaining Buddhahood.

Nichiren writes: “Suffer what there is to suf-
fer, enjoy what there is to enjoy. Regard both
suffering and joy as facts of life, and continue
chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, no matter
what happens. How could this be anything other
than the boundless joy of the Law?” (“Happiness
in This World.” WND-1, 681). We must continue
chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo during times
of both suffering and joy. The emphasis here is
on the word continue, and it is key that we do so
throughout “both suffering and joy.” When con-
fronted with suffering, we must not retreat. We
should “suffer what there is to suffer.” This is nei-
ther resignation nor escapism. We need to fix
our gaze unflinchingly on reality and bravely
challenge it based on chanting Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo. Nichiren is explaining that this is the
correct attitude for practitioners of the Mystic
Law. Faith in Nichiren Buddhism is constantly
directed toward transforming reality.

Of course, such a state of life is not gained
overnight. But if we steadfastly and diligently
continue making efforts to polish ourselves day
in and day out, month after month, year after
year, we will naturally and surely come to attain
it, mirroring the words of the sutra passage
“This cluster of unsurpassed jewels / has come
to us unsought” (LSOC, 124).’

Next, “enjoy what there is to enjoy” (WND-1,
681), can be taken to mean that when we're expe-
riencing joy, we should remember to have
gratitude and make even greater efforts to chant
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, aiming toward the ulti-
mate goal of attaining Buddhahood in this
lifetime. Deepening our seeking spirit in faith is
much more difficult in good times than in bad,
because in good times it is easy to grow lax and
