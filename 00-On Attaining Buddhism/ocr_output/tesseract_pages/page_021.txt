realms in a single moment of life” and the “mutu-
ally inclusive relationship of a single moment of
life and all phenomena.” He thereby sought to
enable people to summon forth the world of
Buddhahood. T’ien-t’ai’s meditation of observ-
ing the mind could be viewed as an appropriate
practice that restored the correct path of the
Lotus Sutra.

Further, in order to enable all people to
perceive and actualize the “mystic truth originally
inherent in all living beings,” Nichiren gave it the
name Myoho-renge-kyo and established the prac-
tice of invoking that name—the practice of
chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. By doing so, he
opened the way for all people to dedicate their
lives to and live based on the mystic truth.

Thus Nichiren established the means by
which all people can awaken to the truth of life
and the universe within their own lives and
actively manifest that truth. Moreover, this truth
is the enlightened wisdom of all Buddhas and is
revealed in the Lotus Sutra, which is the highest
teaching of Buddhism. By basing ourselves on
that truth, we can lead lives of supreme value.
Nichiren Buddhism made this realm of truth
accessible to anyone, anywhere, anytime, no mat-
ter what his or her background. It would be no
exaggeration to say that the practice of chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo in Nichiren Buddhism
gave rise to a Buddhism of the people. This prac-
tice of chanting is indeed the supreme Buddhist
practice, making it possible for us to fundamen-
tally transform our lives.

In other words, to chant Nam-myoho-renge-
kyo is to summon forth our own innate
Buddhahood:' It is the direct path to manifesting

that highest state of life. The wisdom and com-
passion of a Buddha that emerges through
chanting enriches our life-condition, and brings
happiness to ourselves and others. Further, as
more and more people come to chant Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo for the happiness of themselves
and others, it will be possible to forge an alliance
of people filled with the compassion of a Buddha
and to ultimately transform even the destiny of
humankind.

Salute to the Rise of the
Buddhism of the Sun

Another point we should bear in mind regarding
the true meaning of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is
that it is also the name of the life of the Buddha
of the Latter Day, Nichiren Daishonin. Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo and the life of the original
Buddha are indivisibly connected. We could say
that the fundamental truth of Myoho-renge-kyo
that pervades life and the universe was only iden-
tified and established for the first time through
Nichiren himself practicing it and manifesting it
in his behavior. He gave concrete expression to
the Law that people had not been able to perceive
up to that point.

Nichiren’s life as the Buddha of the Latter Day
isa life dedicated to battling evil and vanquishing
ignorance. The struggle to free people from all
misfortune and misery in the world—from all
negative karma and the sufferings of birth, aging,
sickness and death—ultimately entails battling
the fundamental darkness or ignorance that gives
rise to all evil and suffering.
