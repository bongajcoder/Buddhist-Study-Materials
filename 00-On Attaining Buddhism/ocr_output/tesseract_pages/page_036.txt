On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime

trap of practicing “dependent faith,” where we pin
our hopes on having our prayers answered
through the divine or transcendent powers of
gods or Buddhas. This is a typical example of
viewing the Law as outside oneself. The provi-
sional Buddhas of the pre-Lotus Sutra teachings”
readily lend themselves to this kind of faith, the
essence of which is escapism.

Even when they’re obviously suffering, people
of dependent faith avoid looking at their prob-
lems. They don’t have the courage or make any
actual effort to challenge their situation. In such
cases, quite frankly, faith is simply something peo-
ple hide behind as they avoid dealing with reality,
Without a struggle, however, we cannot directly
engage the gears of our human revolution.

To use the analogy of mountain climbing, if we
never actually attempt to ascend its slopes, we'll
never reach the summit, no matter how much time

Passes. If we avoid challenging our own issues, we
can never strengthen and develop ourselves, and
we won't be able to attain Buddhahood in this
lifetime.

In addition, it is important that we ty to rid
our lives of ambiguous, elusive doubt and disbe-
lief as well as grumbling and complaining. The
erroneous belief that Myoho-renge-kyo (the Mys-
tic Law) exists outside of our lives has at its core
an inability to believe that all people—ourselves

and others—possess the Buddha nature. And this
disbelief stems from fundamental darkness,

In terms of attitude in faith, this tendency to
skeptically regard the Buddha nature as “a nice
ideal but one that doesn’t really change reality”
vill manifest itself as prayer that is vague and
acking in conviction. If our efforts in faith are
alfhearted, we cannot change our attitude or
indamentally transform our lives.

As Nichiren indicates in this writing when he

says, “You must summon up deep faith” (WND.),
3), if we hope to make our inherent Buddha
nature the basis of our lives—or as Nichiren
terms it, to attain Buddhahood in this lifetime—
we must continue striving to deepen our faith,
our conviction in chanting Nam-myoho-renge.
kyo. And as our faith deepens, it will manifest as
confident and concrete prayer.

Because our practice of faith is aimed at
attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime, it is essen-
tial that we have a solidly focused attitude when
chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. It is like trying
to shoot an arrow: without a clear target, we won't
draw the bow with any real force or determina-
tion. In the same way, when we replace vague
yearnings with concrete determinations and con-
fident prayer, we can definitely accomplish what
we hope to achieve.

Grumbling and complaining are the principal
gateways to ambiguous, elusive doubt and disbe-
lief Even if we know it is wrong, we may find
ourselves grumbling and complaining in spite of
ourselves. Should such behavior become habitual,
it will act as a constant brake on our growth and
cause us to forget about advancing and improv-
ing ourselves. We will then effectively close off our
own potential, falling into the path of seeking the
Law outside of us. While it might be a real chal-
lenge to stop grumbling and complaining, we can
derive from the Mystic Law the wisdom to control
these tendencies and use them as a springboard
for positive growth and development,

Let's also strictly guard against slandering our
fellow members, Slandering and harboring resent-
ment and jealousy toward others results in denying
their Buddha nature, The inability to believe in
others’ Buddha nature—ust like not believing in
our Own—causes us to stray off course and seek
the Law externally, Our Buddha nature is what
fundamentally spurs us to realize happiness fo,
