eee Chanting NE anaioleee EO To Perceive the Mystic Truth
tee and Establish the Buddhism of the People

The Lotus Sutra is the king of sutras, true and correct in both word and prin-
ciple. Its words are the ultimate reality, and this reality is the Mystic Law
(myoho). It is called the Mystic Law because it reveals the principle of the
mutually inclusive relationship of a single moment of life and all phenomena.
That is why this sutra is the wisdom of all Buddhas.

Life at each moment encompasses the body and mind and the self and
environment of all sentient beings in the Ten Worlds as well as all insentient
beings in the three thousand realms, including plants, sky, earth, and even
the minutest particles of dust. Life at each moment permeates the entire realm
of phenomena and is revealed in all phenomena. To be awakened to this
principle is itself the mutually inclusive relationship of life at each moment
and all phenomena. (WwND-1, 3)

ichiren Daishonin’s next step in opening
Ne great path was to establish the prac-
tice of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.
He appended the word nam—a transliteration of

the Sanskrit word namas, meaning “devotion’—
to the universal truth of Myoho-renge-kyo, and

established the practice of invoking this truth.
Nam means “to dedicate one’s life.” Chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo aloud represents a deter-
mination and vow to dedicate one’s life to the
realm of truth of Myoho-renge-kyo in thought,
word and deed.
