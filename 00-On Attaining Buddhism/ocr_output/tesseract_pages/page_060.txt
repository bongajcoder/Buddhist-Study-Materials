Key Points

The Meaning of Myo—the Middle Way

Nichiren describes this unfathomable nature of the
mind as the “mystic entity of the Middle Way that is
the ultimate reality” (WND-1, 4). The Middle Way
does not simply mean the middle course between
two extremes; it refers to a more lofty perspective
that is swayed by neither extreme but also
embraces them both. Shakyamuni set forth a
sound philosophy and practice transcending the
two then-prevailing extremes of hedonism and
asceticism, and he called this the Middle Way. In
On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime,”
Nichiren says that the ultimate truth, which
transcends the two extremes of existence and
Honexistence and yet also manifests both, is the
Middle Way, and because this is the pinnacle of
truth, he calls it the “ultimate reality” Transcending
€xistence and nonexistence can be taken to mean
transcending impermanent phenomena that
alternate ceaselessly between existence and nonex-
Istence, Further, exhibiting the qualities of both
existence and nonexistence while transcending
both does not refer to a transcendent or absolute
being divorced from impermanent phenomena,
but indicates the truly eternal that encompasses and
resides within impermanent phenomena. (p. 48)

The Meaning of Renge—
the Simultaneity of Cause and Effect

The Mystic Law is not visible to the human eye.
Therefore, the Buddha uses a concrete symbol in
order to help people understand the Law’s won-
drous and mystic nature. This is renge, meaning
“lotus flower.” Why does he employ the lotus
flower? Usually plants flower first and then bear
fruit—a relationship that is used to illustrate
linear or sequential causality, with the flowers
representing the cause and the fruit the effect. In
Buddhism, this is referred to as the nonsimultane-
ity of cause and effect. By contrast, the lotus flower
puts forth its petals and its receptacle (which con-
tains its fruit) simultaneously—in other words, its
fruit is produced at the same time its petals open.
The lotus thus symbolizes the principle of the
simultaneity of cause and effect. (p. 48)

The Meaning of Kkyo—the Practice
for Oneself and Others

We can regard this mystic kyo as the spread of the
Mystic Law from ourselves to others. When “the
mind at this moment” is understood to mean the
Buddha’s mind and “the mind at other moments”
is taken to mean the minds of all living beings,
then kyo refers to the Buddha’s teachings that
expound aspects of his enlightenment regarding
the mystic nature of life, or the mind of myo.
And the king of sutras that directly elucidates
the mind of myo itself is the Lotus Sutra, the
essence of which is Myoho-renge-kyo. In that
sense, the development of kosen-rufu, with peo-
ple propagating the Mystic Law and chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo unstintingly for their
own happiness and that of others and teaching
others to do the same, could be said to corre-
spond to the mystic kyo. (p. 49)

Mastering One’s Mind—
the Path of Mentor and Disciple

To allow ourselves to be mastered by our minds
is to lead a self-centered existence. Ultimately,
we will be pulled this way and that by our con-
stantly wavering minds, succumb to egoism and
sink into the depths of darkness or ignorance.
Conversely, to become the master of our minds
is to live based on the Law. A teacher or mentor
in Buddhism is one who leads and connects
people to the Law—teaching them that the Law
on which they should depend already exists
within their own lives, The disciples in turn seek
the mentor, who embodies and is one with the
Law. Looking to the mentor as a model, they
exert themselves in their Buddhist practice. In
this way, they lead lives in which they become
masters of their minds. In other words, the
existence of a mentor—one who embodies and
lives in complete accord with the Law, and who
teaches people about the vast inner potential
they possess—is indispensable for attaining
Buddhahood in this lifetime. (p. 51)
