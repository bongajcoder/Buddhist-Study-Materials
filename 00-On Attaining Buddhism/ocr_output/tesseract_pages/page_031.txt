The Meaning of Chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo

To chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is to commune
with the Mystic Law. It is a Buddhist practice for
fusing our lives with this Law. At the same time, it
is a battle to conquer the inner darkness that pre-
vents this fusion from taking place. When, through
our practice of faith, we vanquish this darkness of
illusion and ignorance and become one with the
Mystic Law, its infinite power unfolds in our lives.
Such is the immeasurable benefit of chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. (p. 20)

The Cause and Effect of

Attaining Buddhahood
The power of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo
enables us to actualize cause and effect in a single
moment of life—that is, faith (cause) leading to
the manifestation of our Buddhahood (effect).
Considered in this light, one’s voice chanting
Nam-myoho- renge-kyo is the voice of unshakable
faith and seeking spirit that breaks through the
inner darkness of ignorance and illusion, and
sweeps away obstacles and devilish functions. It is
also the courageous lion’s roar that issues forth
from the Buddhahood one reveals as a result of
chanting. (p. 21)

Chanting Like a Galloping Horse

The chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is not
only the voice of faith of ordinary people; it is also
the voice of Buddhahood. For that reason, we
should always try to chant resoundingly, with a
vibrant and vigorous rhythm like that of a gallop-
ing horse. It can also be said that the chanting
of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is an action by which
we affirm that we ourselves are inherently entities
of Myoho-renge-kyo, It represents a struggle to
return to our true, original selves and tap the
innate life force that we have possessed from time
without beginning, (p, 21)

Bridging the Cap Between
Buddhas and Ordinary People

This perceived separation between the nine worlds
and the world of Buddhahood is demolished by
the Lotus Sutra doctrine of “three thousand realms
in a single moment of life’—in other words, the
teaching that “the nine worlds have the potential
for Buddhahood and that Buddhahood retains the
nine worlds” (“The Selection of the Time,’ WND-1,
539). Here we can see the immense importance of
the Lotus Sutra principle of the “mutual possession
of the Ten Worlds.” Nichiren opened the way to
actualizing this latter principle, which is the key to
attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime, by estab-
lishing the practice of chanting Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo. This constitutes in its fullest and most
complete form the teaching of Buddhism that
seeks enlightenment for all human beings. (p. 22)

Manifesting Our Inner Power
That Transcends Us

The Mystic Law is the fundamental law of the uni-
verse. Its universality transcends our individual
selves. As indicated by its description as the “mystic
truth that is originally inherent in all living beings,”
however, the Mystic Law also exists within our lives
(“On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime,”
WND-1, 3). It both resides within us and transcends
us. Put another way, the Mystic Law is inherent in
our lives because it is the all-embracing Law that
pervades everything in the universe. (p. 23)

Nam-myoho-renge-kyo
ls Your Own Life!

[Mr. Toda] also often spoke of the spirit of faith we
need in order to perceive the Mystic Law within us,
saying: “You have to be resolved that Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo is your own life!” or “Propagating the
Mystic Law in the Latter Day means firmly believing
that your life is nothing apart from Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo!” This is the spirit Nichiren teaches in the
passage, “When you chant myoho and recite renge,
you must summon up deep faith that Myoho-renge-
kyo is your life itself (“On Attaining Buddhahood in
This Lifetime,” WND-1, 3). (p. 25)
