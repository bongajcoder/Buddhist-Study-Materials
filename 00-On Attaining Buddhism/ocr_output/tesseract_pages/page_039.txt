ourselves and others. Not to believe in the Buddha
nature is to deny the spirit of the Lotus Sutra,
which teaches that all people have the potential for
Buddhahood. Consequently, Nichiren sternly
warns that if we go against the spirit of the sutra,
not only won’t we accomplish our desire to attain
Buddhahood in this lifetime, but we will end up
committing slander of the Law."

Also, unless we practice together united in the
spirit of “many in body, one in mind,” the great
desire for kosen-rufu cannot be fulfilled.”

Let us confirm once again that chanting Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo for the happiness of ourselves
and others is the true means for attaining Bud-
dhahood in this lifetime. Each person has the
potential to become a Buddha.

The Spirit of the First Three Presidents
Pulses in the Soka Gakkai

A Buddhist teaching that affirms the existence of
the Law in each person’s life is one that treasures
the individual. It calls out to each person, encour-
ages his or her individual human revolution and
seeks to lead all people to enlightenment. In the
appearance of one person after another embracing
faith, we find the principle of bodhisattvas steadily
emerging from the earth to propagate the Law, and
the unchanging formula of kosen-rufu."

This is the path of the Soka Gakkai that the first
three presidents—Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, Josei
Toda and myself—have steadfastly followed.
That is why the Soka Gakkai has achieved such phe-
nomenal development and why our kosen-rufu
movement has spread throughout the entire world.

In contrast, Buddhist teachings that view the
Law as existing outside one’s own life tend to be
authoritarian or formalistic, to disregard and
repress people. They are prone to emphasizing rit-
uals or clerical authority, while their followers
passively seek to assuage their anxieties through
dependence on ceremonies or clergy. Further, tak-
ing advantage of the fact that one of human beings’
greatest sources of anxiety is death and what comes
after, Buddhist schools of this kind in Japan have
come to function almost exclusively as purveyors
of funeral and memorial services for the deceased,
devolving into what is known as “funeral Bud-
dhism.” They offer no philosophy that empowers
people or enables them to live better lives.

The Soka Gakkai’s founder, President
Makiguchi, asserted that Nichiren Buddhism is a
“teaching for transforming one’s life.” To believe
that the Mystic Law of Myoho-renge-kyo exists
within us is to have the confidence that we will
definitely become happy and attain Buddhahood
in this lifetime. Faith also means actively working
for kosen-rufu through sharing Nichiren Bud-
dhism based on the conviction that it holds the
key to happiness for both ourselves and others.
This genuine faith pervades the Soka Gakkai and
the SGI. The greatness of the Soka Gakkai and the
first three presidents’ spirit of the oneness of
mentor and disciple shine in the undertaking this
most difficult of challenges—that of awakening
people to the Law within.

President Toda used to say, “You should
resolve, ‘I am Myoho-renge-kyo!”” The Mystic
Law is the “highly effective medicine” (The Lotus
Sutra and Its Opening and Closing Sutras, p. 269)
that relieves the sufferings of all people. It is also
