If you wish to free yourself from the sufferings of birth and death you have
endured since time without beginning and to attain without fail unsurpassed
enlightenment in this lifetime, you must perceive the mystic truth that is orig-
inally inherent in all living beings. This truth is Myoho-renge-kyo. Chanting
Myoho-renge-kyo will therefore enable you to grasp the mystic truth innate
in all life. (“On Atsaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime” The Writings of Nichiren Daishonin, vol. 1, p. 3)

ust what constitutes a deeply meaningful life?

What is true happiness? Nichiren Buddhism

is a teaching of hope that enables us to forge
a state of unsurpassed and indestructible happi-
ness and to lead a life of supreme value, while
also helping others do the same.

All people have the potential to attain
Buddhahood; moreover, they can gain that lofty
state just as they are and in fact are assured
of being able to do so in this lifetime. Nichiren
Buddhism clearly elucidates this wonderful path
to enlightenment.

Nichiren Daishonin’s profound teaching of

attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime was 4
revolutionary concept that turned prevailing
Buddhist thought on its head. Indeed, it con-
tinues to shine today as a principle that can
powerfully transform the age and open a bright
future for our modern world in the twenty-first
century.

Therefore, I look forward to studying
Nichiren’s writing “On Attaining Buddhahood in
This Lifetime” together with you, as we embark in
high spirits on a new journey of growth and
development toward the Soka Gakkai’s eightieth
anniversary (in 2010).
