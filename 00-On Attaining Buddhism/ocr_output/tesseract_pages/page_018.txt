ourselves—our minds or each life-moment—and
the universe; its meaning is that all phenomena
are contained in one’s life and that one’s life
pervades all phenomena. This principle no
doubt corresponds in meaning to the “principle
of inherence and pervasion™ articulated by
Nichikan, an early eighteenth-century restorer
of Nichiren Buddhism, in describing the doc-
trine of “three thousand realms in a single
moment of life”

The cosmic life enfolds and pervades every-
thing, and because it does so, it is also inherent in
all things. The oneness of the cosmic life and our
individual lives lies at the heart of the “principle
of the mutually inclusive relationship of a single
moment of life and all phenomena.” To awaken to
this mystic truth is to attain the Buddha’s “unsur-

The question is how to enable all people to per-
ceive this “mystic truth that is originally
Buddhism will not be possible if only a very
forth for apprehending the mystic truth. Before
Nichiren Daishonin, the Great Teacher T’ien-
tai of China tried to establish the means for
perceiving this mystic truth through the prac-
tice of observing the mind, also known as the
practice of concentration and insight. But it was
not a means readily accessible to the people of
the Latter Day of the Law.

The initial step Nichiren took in opening the
great path to universal enlightenment was to
name the mystic truth. The universally inherent
mystic truth originally had no name, but as
Nichiren explains in “The Entity of the Mystic
Law,’ a sage awakened to this truth in his own life

could give it the most appropriate name (see
WND-1, 421). Naming something is a creative
process. Giving a name that accurately grasps the
essence of a thing has the important effect of
making that essence available to all people; it
enables all people to share in its value.

In “On Attaining Buddhahood in This Life-
time,” as indicated by the passage “the mystic
truth that is originally inherent in all living beings
is Myoho-renge-kyo,” Nichiren states that this
mystic truth that constitutes the fundamental
Law of the universe is none other than Myoho-
renge-kyo. Strictly speaking, the term Myoho-
renge-kyo existed prior to this as the title of the
Lotus Sutra, but Nichiren was the first to identify
Myoho-renge-kyo as being the name of the prin-
ciple of the “true aspect of all phenomena,”
which the Lotus Sutra teaches is the profound
wisdom of all Buddhas. Also, although the “Life
Span” chapter of the Lotus Sutra expounds the
life of the eternal Buddha from the standpoint of
Shakyamuni, it was Nichiren who first revealed
that the essence of the Buddha’s eternal life—the
“heart of the ‘Life Span’ chapter’—is Myoho-
renge-kyo (see “The Object of Devotion for
Observing the Mind,” WND-1, 371).

The eternal Buddha, since attaining enlighten-
ment in the remote past, repeatedly undergoes the
cycle of birth and death as a Buddha while appear-
ing in various forms within the Ten Worlds‘ for the
salvation of all living beings. The “Life Span” chap-
ter reveals that living beings of the Ten Worlds
(including Buddhas), and the phenomena of birth
and death as well, are all manifestations of the great
eternal life of the universe. Because Nichiren says
that the “heart of the ‘Life Span’ chapter” is Myoho-
tenge-kyo, we can infer that Myoho-renge-kyo is
the name of the great, eternal, universal life that is
revealed in the “Life Span” chapter.

Living beings in the nine worlds, repeatedly
undergoing birth and death, also follow the
