Myoho-renge-kyo, with just that single sound we
summon forth and manifest the Buddha nature of
all Buddhas; all existences; all bodhisattvas; all
voice-hearers; all the deities such as Brahma,
Shakra, and King Yama; the sun and moon, and
the myriad stars; the heavenly gods and earthly
deities, on down to hell-dwellers, hungry spirits,
animals, asuras, human and heavenly beings, and
all other living beings. This blessing is immeasur-
able and boundless” (WND-1, 887).

Regarding the meaning of chanting Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo, he further states: “When we
revere Myoho-renge-kyo inherent in our own
life as the object of devotion, the Buddha nature
within us is summoned forth and manifested by
our chanting of Nam-myoho-tenge-kyo. This is
what is meant by “Buddha” (WND-1, 887). The
expression “is summoned forth and manifested”
points to the profound significance of the

Nichiren uses a wonderful metaphor to
ing the inner Buddha nature: “When a caged bird
sings, birds who are flying in the sky are thereby
summoned and gather around, and when the
birds flying in the sky gather around, the bird in
the cage strives to get out” (WND-1, 887).

The singing of the caged bird refers to the
chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo by ordinary
people who, shackled in the chains of fundamen-
tal darkness and earthly desires, arouse faith in
the Mystic Law. In other words, it is the chanting
of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo with faith, which is
expressed as the determination to win over all
obstacles and become happy without fail through
the power of the Mystic Law.

The power of such strong, determined chant-
ing calls forth the Buddha nature in all living
beings. Not only does the Buddha nature of
Brahma and Shakra and of the Buddhas and

On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime

bodhisattvas throughout the universe manifest,
but those chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo can
also sever the chains of fundamental darkness
and illusion, and reveal their own Buddha nature.
In other words, it is the power of our voices
chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo that connects
our lives with the Mystic Law pervading all phe-
nomena of the three thousand realms.’

In “Letter to Niike,” Nichiren further explains
the significance of chanting through the analogy
of a mother bird and an egg.'° He says that the
chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is “like the
warmth of the mother bird” (WND-1, 1030). At
first there is nothing inside the egg but liquid, but
as a result of being warmed by the mother bird,
the beak, eyes and feathers are formed. Eventually,
the baby bird breaks through the shell and hatches,
and is soon flying into the sky like its mother. In
this analogy, the substance within the egg repre-
sents the Buddha nature of living beings, while
the mother bird represents the Buddha who leads
others to enlightenment. The chanting of Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo is at once the voice of faith of
ordinary people and a function of the life-state of
Buddhahood.

Nichiren’s most important admonition in
regard to attaining enlightenment through chant-
ing Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is that we must not
view the Law as something outside ourselves. If
we think the Law exists externally, then we are
reverting to the kind of divide between Buddhas
and ordinary people found in the pre-Lotus Sutra
teachings.
