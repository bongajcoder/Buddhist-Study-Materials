Nam-myoho-renge-kyo filled with a seeking
spirit to continually develop our faith or confi-
dence in its power. “It is the heart that is
important,” Nichiren asserts (“The Strategy of the
Lotus Sutra,” WND-1, 1000). When it comes to
chanting, therefore, we should above all strive to
summon forth the courage with which to over-
come illusion without being defeated by the
“three obstacles and four devils.”

Myoho-renge-kyo is the name of the ultimate
mystic truth, and Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is the
name of the life-state of Buddhas who embody
and reveal this truth. Thus, when we chant Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo with conviction, the infinite
benefit of Myoho-renge-kyo unfolds in our lives.
This is what it means to bring forth the world of
Buddhahood.

At work here is the principle of “cause and
effect in a single moment of life,”? in which faith
is the cause and manifesting the life-state of Bud-
dhahood is the effect. When we continue
chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo through times
of both suffering and joy while striving for our
own happiness and that of others, we can estab-
lish as the core and innermost essence of our lives
the benefit of the cause and effect for attaining
Buddhahood—which are themselves contained
within the practice of chanting. When we do so,
the indomitable state of Buddhahood emerges
within us. This is the meaning of “attaining Bud-
dhahood in this lifetime.

In his treatise “The Object of Devotion for
Observing the Mind,” Nichiren states: “Shakya-
muni Buddha, who has attained perfect
enlightenment, is our own flesh and blood. His
practices and the resulting virtues are our bones
and marrow” (WND-1, 365). He explains that to
embrace Myoho-renge-kyo is in itself attaining

enlightenment.’ The power of chanting Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo enables us to actualize cause
and effect in a single moment of life—that is,
faith (cause) leading to the manifestation of our
Buddhahood (effect).

Considered in this light, one’s voice chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is the voice of unshak-
able faith and seeking spirit that breaks through
the inner darkness of ignorance and illusion, and
sweeps away obstacles and devilish functions. It is
also the courageous lion’s roar that issues forth
from the Buddhahood one reveals as a result of
chanting.

The chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is
not only the voice of faith of ordinary people; it is
also the voice of Buddhahood. For that reason, we
should always try to chant resoundingly, with a
vibrant and vigorous rhythm like that of a gallop-
ing horse.

It can also be said that the chanting of Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo is an action by which we affirm
that we ourselves are inherently entities of
Myoho-renge-kyo. It represents a struggle to
return to our true, original selves and tap the
innate life force that we have possessed from time
without beginning.

Nichiren declares: “There is no true happiness
for human beings other than chanting Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo” (“Happiness in This World,”
WND-1, 681). This happiness, he says, is the
“boundless joy of the Law.”> “Joy of the Law”
describes the unshakable happiness and peace
of mind inherent in all existence. To experience
this joy means to fully savor and enjoy the infi-
nite life force that is one with the Mystic Law.
Nichiren explains that the only way for us to
taste the joy of the Mystic Law is through chant-
ing Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.
