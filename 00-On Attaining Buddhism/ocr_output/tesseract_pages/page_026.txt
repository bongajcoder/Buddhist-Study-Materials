The Mystic Law and
Incomplete Teachings

Given that chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo has
such profound meaning, it is crucial to remember
when we chant that Myoho-renge-kyo is our lives
themselves. If we lose sight of this point, then no
matter how much we may chant, we will have
departed from the practice of chanting taught by
Nichiren Daishonin.

Therefore, in “On Attaining Buddhahood in
This Lifetime,” Nichiren writes in stern warning,
“Even though you chant and believe in Myoho-
renge-kyo, if you think the Law is outside yourself,
you are embracing not the Mystic Law but an infe-
that is perfect and complete; in contrast, an incom-

The above passage contains a profound phi-
losophy that overcomes one of the serious pitfalls
to which religion tends to succumb, It also
embodies a crucial philosophy of faith for attain-
ing genuine happiness.

Religion is generally held to be a universal
endeavor to connect the human being to the infi-
nite, absolute and sacred. While in a sense this may
be true, it seems that many religions postulate
from the outset a separation between the secular
and the sacred, and between human beings and
gods or Buddhas, and thus seek to bridge that gap.

Nichiren, however, regards teachings that view
the absolute or sacred as separate from human
beings as incomplete. And he cites as an example
the provisional, pre-Lotus Sutra teachings, which
do not set forth the principles or practices that
enable ordinary people to attain Buddhahood in
this lifetime. Rather, they espouse that one must
first undergo innumerable kalpas* of austere
practice before enlightenment can be achieved.

On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime

In the provisional, pre-Lotus Sutra teachings,
a Virtually insurmountable gulf exists between
Buddhas and ordinary people. Only a very few
exceptional practitioners who, after having
undergone austerities for countless kalpas, can
even attempt to reach the goal of enlightenment.
Moreover, according to these teachings, it is
inconceivable for someone who has become a
Buddha to go back to being an ordinary person.
As a rule, according to these teachings, the world
where Buddhas dwell is not this strife-filled saha
world where ordinary people reside. Buddhas and
ordinary people are completely separate. There-
fore, as long as that divide exists between the
world of Buddhahood and the nine worlds (the
tealm of ordinary beings), it naturally follows
that there is no way for all people to attain
enlightenment. In this worldview, ordinary peo-
ple and the idealized Buddhas are poles apart,
thus leaving ordinary people with no option but
to aspire for salvation through the assistance or
intervention of such Buddhas.

This perceived separation between the nine
worlds and the world of Buddhahood’ is demol-
ished by the Lotus Sutra doctrine of “three
thousand realms in a single moment of life’—
in other words, the teaching that “the nine
worlds have the potential for Buddhahood and
that Buddhahood retains the nine worlds”
(“The Selection of the Time,” WND-1, 539).'
Here we can see the immense importance of the
Lotus Sutra principle of the “mutual possession
of the Ten Worlds.”

Nichiren opened the way to actualizing this
latter principle, which is the key to attaining Bud-
dhahood in this lifetime, by establishing the
practice of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. This
constitutes in its fullest and most complete form
the teaching of Buddhism that seeks enlighten-
ment for all human beings.
