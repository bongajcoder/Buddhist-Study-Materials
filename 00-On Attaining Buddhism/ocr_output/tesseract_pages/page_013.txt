between rich and poor, and rampant discrimina-
tion. One conclusion from my dialogues with
leading thinkers is that the only real solution is for
human beings themselves to change, that the sole
key lies in human revolution.

It could further be said that without establish-
ing a correct view of life and death, it is
impossible to conquer inner darkness and delu-
sion at the most fundamental level. Without the
Middle Way view of life and death—a view that
rejects the extremes of the doctrine of annihila-
tion and the doctrine of eternity-—true and
lasting happiness cannot be achieved.

The only way for human beings to change is
for them to conquer their inner darkness and
rediscover the eternal dignity within their own
lives. Cultivating the noble spirit with which all
people are originally endowed will directly lead to
a change in the destiny of humankind. With that
conviction, we of the SGI have been working to
build a network of good all around the globe.

In the course of these lectures, I will comment
further on the growing expectations and praise for
this unprecedented endeavor we are undertaking.

At the end of “On Attaining Buddhahood in
This Lifetime,” Nichiren Daishonin writes: “Never
doubt in the slightest” (WND-1, 4). He is telling

LLL ee

us that we should have complete confidence in
the revealing of our Buddhahood in this lifetime.
His words also contain the warning that unless we
maintain this strong confidence, or faith, we can
easily lose sight of the fundamental goal of attain-
ing Buddhahood in this lifetime and fall into the
depths of darkness and delusion.

All people at the core of their lives yearn to
attain enlightenment. But there is no teaching
more difficult to believe or understand than the
teaching that we can definitely manifest the state
of Buddhahood in our present existence. We of
the SGI have taken on the challenge of practicing
this profound teaching and sharing it widely with
others around the globe.

In today’s world, we, the courageous Bodhi-
sattvas of the Earth, are showing great actual
proof of humankind’s potential to transform
its destiny. Proud of our noble mission, let us
continue to joyously spread Nichiren Buddhism—
with its teaching of attaining Buddhahood in this
lifetime that enables all people to achieve unsur-
passed happiness—and lead the most valuable
and fulfilling lives possible.

1. Toki Jonin: A lay follower of Nichiren Daishonin. He lived in Wakamiya,
Katsushika District of Shimosa Province (part of present-day Chiba Prefec-
ture) and served as a retainer to Lord Chiba, He was the recipient of many
of Nichiren’s writings, including “The Object of Devotion for Observing
the Mind,” and carefully preserved them.

2. In “How Those Initially Aspiring to the Way Can Attain Buddhahood
through the Lotus Sutra,” Nichiren writes: “When we revere Myoho-renge-
kyo inherent in our own life as the object of devotion, the Buddha nature
within us is summoned forth and manifested by our chanting of Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo, This is what is meant by ‘Buddha.’ To illustrate, when a
caged bird sings, birds who are flying in the sky are thereby summoned
and gather around, and when the birds flying in the sky gather around, the
bird in the cage strives to get out. When with our mouths we chant the
Mystic Law, our Buddha nature, being summoned, will invariably emerge”
(WND-1, 887).

3. In “Devadatta,” the twelfth chapter of the Lotus Sutra, the ¢ight-year-old
daughter of the dragon king Sagara conceives the desire for enlightenment
when she hears Bodhisattva Manjushri preach the Lotus Sutra, She comes
to offers a jewel to Shakyamuni and instantaneously perfects the bodhi-
sattva practice. She then appears in a land to the south called Spotless
World and manifests the state of Buddhahood without changing her

dragon form and preaches the Lotus Sutra te ail living beings there (see
The Lotus Sutra and Its Opening and Closing Sutras, pp. 226-23).

4. In ancient Indian cosmology, an extremely long period of ume.

. In his writing “The Doctrine of Three Thousand Realms in a Single
Moment of Life,” Nichiren statess “Lf votaries of the Lotus Sutra carry out
religious practice as the sutra directs, then every one of them without
exception will surely attain Buddhahood within his or her present lifetime.
To cite an analogy, if one plants the fields in spring and summer, then,
whether it be early or late, one is certain to reap a harvest within the year.
Votaries of the Lotus Sutra fall into three categories, superior, middling,
inferior, depending upon their capacities, and yet all will invariably attain
enlightenment within a single lifetime” (WND-2, 83).

?. The doctrine of annihilation is the mistaken attachment to the notion that
lite begins with birth and ends with death, According to this view, there is
only the present life, and death represents a complete cessation of existence
both physical and spiritual. The doctrine of eternity is also the mistaken
notion that what exists here in the present is permanent and unchanging,
This view rejects causality, so that neither practicing good nor practicing
evil produces any change in one’s condition,
