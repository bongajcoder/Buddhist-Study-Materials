birth and death that continues from the infinite
past into the infinite future. Buddhism holds that
this never-ending round of suffering ultimately
arises from earthly desires, and that a negative
cycle of earthly desires, karma and suffering is
part and parcel of transmigration. In this sense,
“the sufferings of birth and death endured since
time without beginning” also represents an inter-
minable succession of illusion and suffering.

Because the thought of such endless transmi-
gration is ultimately unbearable, people naturally
came to wish for a way to put an end to this
painful cycle and free themselves from the chains
of delusion and suffering.

In Buddhism, there are two basic approaches to
liberation from the suffering of this cycle. One
view holds that people can free themselves from
the endless karmic cycle of birth and death by
eradicating earthly desires believed to cause it. The
other is the Mahayana approach, in which the
essence of life that undergoes transmigration is not
viewed as a transient, impermanent phenomenon.

The Mahayana teachings, for example, espouse
the concept of undergoing the cycle of birth and
death in accordance with the bodhisattva vow to
guide living beings to enlightenment; or they view
the oscillation between birth and death as a cycle
of emerging from and returning to the funda-
mental, all-embracing life of the universe. The
latter view can be easily understood using the
metaphor of waves on the ocean: birth is like a
wave appearing on the surface of the ocean—the
life of the universe—while death is the wave sub-
merging back into that ocean. Gaining such an
understanding of the essence of our own lives,
which repeat the cycle of birth and death, is to
attain “unsurpassed enlightenment,” the highest
awakening of the Buddha.

The Mystic Truth Embraces
and Is Inherent in All Things

In this passage, to “perceive the mystic truth that is
originally inherent in all living beings” means to
“attain unsurpassed enlightenment.” The wisdom
to apprehend this universally inherent truth repre-
sents the supreme enlightenment of the Buddha.

The point where Buddhism radically departs
from many other philosophies and religions is
that it uncovered within the individual’s own life
the Law, or limitless inner power, for resolving all
suffering on the most essential level. A Buddha is
one who, based on this Law, has attained the ulti-
mate wisdom to fundamentally put an end to
suffering and construct indestructible happiness.

Buddhism is a teaching of unparalleled
humanism that stresses the boundless potential
within human beings. That’s why it is called the
“internal way.”

To “perceive the mystic truth that is originally
inherent in all living beings” is to “attain unsur-
passed enlightenment”; it is the sole means for
freeing oneself from “the sufferings of birth and
death endured since time without beginning.”
This is Shakyamuni’s starting point, and the
entirety of Buddhist thought. The scripture that
proclaims this philosophy of the “internal way” is
the Lotus Sutra, which teaches that all people can
attain enlightenment. The Lotus Sutra could be
said to embody the ultimate principle of respect
for human dignity.

In this writing, Nichiren Daishonin says that
the “mystic truth that is originally inherent in all
living beings” is the “principle of the mutually
inclusive relationship of a single moment of life
and all phenomena.” This latter principle refers to
the inscrutable relationship that exists between |
