The Path of Mentor and Disciple
Based on the Law

rail the story of the Ikegami brothers’ tri-
ee a we also learn the faith of the oneness
_ and disciple. Because the brothers
ei themselves exactly as Nichiren Dai-
i ag they could overcome their

~~ ai; discern the scheming of Ryokan, chief
_. of Gokuraku-ji, behind their father’s

10ns; and in the end win the dramatic victory
of their father taking faith.

: To allow ourselves to be mastered by our
ie is to lead a self-centered existence. Ulti-
ia we will be pulled this way and that by our
are ae wavering minds, succumb to egoism
és s into the depths of darkness or igno-

he Conversely, to become the master of our
Minds is to live based on the Law.

A teacher or mentor in Buddhism is one who
leads and connects people to the Law—teaching
them that the Law on which they should depend
already exists within their own lives. The disciples
in turn seek the mentor, who embodies and is one
with the Law. Looking to the mentor as a model,
they exert themselves in their Buddhist practice.
In this way, they lead lives in which they become
Masters of their minds.

In other words, the existence of a mentor—
one who embodies and lives in complete accord
with the Law, and who teaches people about the
vast inner potential they possess—is indispen-
sable for attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime.
I had a mentor who practiced as the Buddha
taught—our second Soka Gakkai president,
Josei Toda, who dedicated his life to widely

propagating Nichiren Buddhism in the modern
age—and that has made me who I am today.
President Toda is always with me as my spiritual
mentor, Even now, day after day, and moment
by moment, I am carrying on a dialogue with

my mentor in my heart. This is the spirit of the
oneness of mentor and disciple. Those who
hold fast to their spiritual mentor as their com-
pass and exert themselves as that mentor
teaches are people who live based on the Law.
Nichiren Buddhism is a teaching founded on
the oneness of mentor and disciple. And the
Lotus Sutra is likewise a scripture of the oneness
of mentor and disciple.

At the end of this writing, to convey the
importance of the mentor-disciple relationship
in walking the great path of attaining Buddha-
hood in this lifetime, Nichiren cites a passage
from the “Supernatural Powers” chapter of the
Lotus Sutra.” Next time, I will discuss the pro-
found meaning of this passage, but suffice it to
say here that the path to attaining Buddhahood
is found in the practice of Bodhisattvas of
the Earth who chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo,
the Law inherent in their lives, for both their
own happiness and that of others, and who teach
others to do the same.

Above all, the great path to attaining Buddha-
hood in this lifetime lies in practicing faith with
the spirit of the oneness of mentor and disciple,
making our minds one with the lofty mind of
the Buddha and not being swayed by our inner
darkness or the three poisons—greed, anger and
foolishness. Faith based on the mentor-disciple
spirit is the key to opening the treasure within
our lives that is as vast as the universe. Moreover,
courageously exerting ourselves in chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and taking action for
kosen-rufu is the direct path to attaining Buddha-
hood in this lifetime.
