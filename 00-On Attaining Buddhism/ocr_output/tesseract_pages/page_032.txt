You must never think that any of the eighty thousand sacred teachings of
Shakyamuni Buddha's lifetime or any of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas of the
ten directions and three existences are outside yourself. Your practice of the
Buddhist teachings will not relieve you of the sufferings of birth and death in
the least unless you perceive the true nature of your life, If you seek enlighten-
ment outside yourself, then your performing even ten thousand practices and
ten thousand good deeds will be in vain. It is like the case of a poor man who
spends night and day counting his neighbor's wealth but gains not even half a
coin. That is why the T’ien-t'ai school’s commentary states, “Unless one per-
ceives the nature of one’s life, one cannot eradicate one’s grave offenses.”! This
passage implies that, unless one perceives the nature of one’s life, one’s prac-
tice will become an endless, painful austerity. Therefore, such students of
Buddhism are condemned as non-Buddhist. [T’ien-t’ai’s] Great Concentration
and Insight states that, although they study Buddhism, their views are no dif-
ferent from those of non-Buddhists.

Whether you chant the Buddha’s name; recite the sutra, or merely offer
flowers and incense, all your virtuous acts will implant benefits and roots of
goodness in your life, With this conviction, you should strive in faith. (On
Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime,” The Writings of Nichiren Daishonin, vol. 1, pp. 3-4)
