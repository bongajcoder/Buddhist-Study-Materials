motto by which I have lived my life. In all my
struggles, I have borne these words ever in mind.

The “Emerging from the Earth” chapter
of the Lotus Sutra describes countless
bodhisattvas appearing from out of the
eee emergence of the Bodhisattvas of
: Be It explains that they have been
es the empty space underneath the
am a and seeking the Buddha way with
e iligence (see LSOC, 259). The above
as in The Record of the Orally Transmit-
ee ings clarifies from the standpoint of

iren Buddhism the nature of their dili-

8€Nce or tireless exertion.
a Se of Nichiren Buddhism is that
ae . exert themselves assiduously to seek
fee Way automatically manifest the
an om fe) the Buddha eternally endowed with
a 08 bodies—in other words, they bring
eir inherent Buddhahood.
be Be we chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo as if
€ntrate in a single moment the arduous
exertions of incalculable eons—“exhausting the
ie and trials of millions of kalpas” (see OTT,
)—then the life-state of the Buddha eternal-
Y endowed with the three bodies (namely, our
Buddhahood) appears within us instant after
Instant.

Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is a diligent practice.
Arousing deep faith and steadfastly continuing
to chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo truly requires
constant and unflagging exertion. Persevering
single-mindedly and consistently in this practice
will lead us to attain Buddhahood in this
lifetime. Through such efforts, our inherent
Buddhahood—the Buddha eternally endowed
with the three bodies—wells forth in the form
of inexhaustible courage, perseverance, joy,
wisdom and compassion.

Praying for Brave and
Vigorous Youth To Appear

Exerting oneself means doing so bravely and
vigorously. Without courage and vigor, there is
no true exertion. The first Soka Gakkai presi-
dent, Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, also led a life of
brave and vigorous endeavor. He once said to
young people: “Exert yourselves bravely and
vigorously! Buddhism means taking action; it
means constantly striving. Even at my age,
that’s what I’m doing.”

President Toda also remarked to youth,
“Youth who wish for the happiness of humanity
should first themselves seek the essence of this
lofty philosophy of human revolution. They
should exert themselves bravely and vigorously
to fight and triumph over all manifestations of
the three powerful enemies and the three
obstacles and four devils.”

My sentiments are exactly the same. I chant
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo ardently for brave and
vigorous disciples, brave and vigorous youth, to
appear throughout the world. | am wholeheart-
edly chanting for this every day. Exerting oneself
bravely and vigorously is truly the hallmark of
the Soka Gakkai’s mentor-disciple spirit.

The practice of chanting Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo is the driving force for progress,
the driving force for victory. Every challenge
should begin with chanting Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo. No one is a match for those who
steadfastly chant.

Diligently chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo
morning and evening, let us thoroughly polish
ourselves inside and construct lives in which we
win victory after victory.
