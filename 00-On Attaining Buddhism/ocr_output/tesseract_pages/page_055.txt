Nichiren describes this unfathomable
nature of the mind as the “mystic entity of the
Middle Way that is the ultimate reality” (WND-
1, 4). The Middle Way does not simply mean
the middle course between two extremes; it
refers to a more lofty perspective that is swayed
by neither extreme but also embraces them
both. Shakyamuni set forth a sound philosophy
and practice transcending the two then-pre-
vailing extremes of hedonism and asceticism,
and he called this the Middle Way. In “On
Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime,” Nich-
iren says that the ultimate truth, which
transcends the two extremes of existence and
nonexistence and yet also manifests both, is the
Middle Way, and because this is the pinnacle of
truth, he calls it the “ultimate reality.”

Transcending existence and nonexistence can
be taken to mean transcending impermanent
phenomena that alternate ceaselessly between

Renge Refers to the Principle of the

Nichiren Daishonin next states that ho, meaning
Law or phenomena, is the name given to the
manifestations of the mystic nature of our lives or
minds—a term that can also be expressed as the
wondrous mind or the “mind of myo.” The mind
of myo is itself the Mystic Law. Abstract words
and theories alone—be they the concepts of
nonsubstantiality or the unification of the three
truths—cannot be called the Mystic Law. For only
when the Mystic Law is expressed as the highest
human wisdom based on the Middle Way can it
spread as a guide and compass, and as a teaching
or Law (ho) for people to follow.

In addition, Nichiren says: “Renge, which
means lotus flower, is used to symbolize the won-
der of this Law” (WND-1, 4). The Mystic Law is
not visible to the human eye. Therefore, the Bud-
dha uses a concrete symbol in order to help
people understand the Law’s wondrous and mys-
tic nature. This is renge, meaning “lotus flower.”
Why does he employ the lotus flower? Usually
plants flower first and then bear fruit—a relation-
ship that is used to illustrate linear or sequential
causality, with the flowers representing the cause
and the fruit the effect. In Buddhism, this is
referred to as the nonsimultaneity of cause and
effect. By contrast, the lotus flower puts forth its
petals and its receptacle (which contains its fruit)
simultaneously—in other words, its fruit is pro-

_ duced at the same time its petals open. The lotus

thus symbolizes the principle of the simultaneity
