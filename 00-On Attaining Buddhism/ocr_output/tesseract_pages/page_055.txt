Nichiren describes this unfathomable
nature of the mind as the “mystic entity of the
Middle Way that is the ultimate reality” (WND-
1, 4). The Middle Way does not simply mean
the middle course between two extremes; it
refers to a more lofty perspective that is swayed
by neither extreme but also embraces them
both. Shakyamuni set forth a sound philosophy
and practice transcending the two then-pre-
vailing extremes of hedonism and asceticism,
and he called this the Middle Way. In “On
Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime.” Nich-
iren says that the ultimate truth, which
transcends the two extremes of existence and
nonexistence and yet also manifests both, is the
Middle Way, and because this is the pinnacle of
truth, he calls it the “ultimate reality.”

Transcending existence and nonexistence can
be taken to mean transcending impermanent
phenomena that alternate ceaselessly between
existence and nonexistence. Further, exhibiting
the qualities of both existence and nonexistence
while transcending both does not refer to a tran-
scendent or absolute being divorced from
impermanent phenomena, but indicates the truly
eternal that encompasses and resides within
impermanent phenomena.

Although Nichiren explains the mysterious
nature of life or mind in terms of the concepts
of existence and nonexistence in this writing,
what he says here is comparable to Nagarjuna’s
concept of nonsubstantiality,' and to T’ien-
Vai’s concepts of the unification of the three
truths’ and the threefold contemplation in a
single mind.’ Essentially, “the mystic entity of
the Middle Way that is the ultimate reality” of
which Nichiren speaks refers to our lives or
minds that are one with the ultimate truth—a
concept expressed variously as nonsubstantial-
ity, the unification of the three truths, or
threefold contemplation in a single mind.

On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime

Renge Refers to the Principle of the
Simultaneity of Cause and Effect

Nichiren Daishonin next states that ho, meaning
Law or phenomena, is the name given to the
manifestations of the mystic nature of our lives or
minds—a term that can also be expressed as the
wondrous mind or the “mind of myo.” The mind
of myo is itself the Mystic Law. Abstract words
and theories alone—be they the concepts of
nonsubstantiality or the unification of the three
truths—cannot be called the Mystic Law. For only
when the Mystic Law is expressed as the highest
human wisdom based on the Middle Way can it
spread as a guide and compass, and as a teaching
or Law (ho) for people to follow.

In addition, Nichiren says: “Renge, which
means lotus flower, is used to symbolize the won-
der of this Law” (WND-1, 4). The Mystic Law is
not visible to the human eye. Therefore, the Bud-
dha uses a concrete symbol in order to help
people understand the Law’s wondrous and mys-
tic nature. This is renge, meaning “lotus flower.”

Why does he employ the lotus flower? Usually
plants flower first and then bear fruit—a relation-
ship that is used to illustrate linear or sequential
causality, with the flowers representing the cause
and the fruit the effect. In Buddhism, this is
referred to as the nonsimultaneity of cause and
effect. By contrast, the lotus flower puts forth its
petals and its receptacle (which contains its fruit)
simultaneously—in other words,
duced at the same time its petals
thus symbolizes the princi
of cause and effect,

The provisional teachings other than the Lotus
Sutra do not teach that Buddhahood is inherent
within the lives of ordinary people, which is
regarded as the cause for attaining enlightenment.
Rather, they teach that one can only gain the state
of Buddhahood after undergoing countless eons of
