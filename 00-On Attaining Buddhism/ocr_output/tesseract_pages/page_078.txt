2. As used here, “the Buddha’s name” denotes Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.

3. Three meanings of myo: In “The Daimoku of the Lotus Sutra.”
Nichiren Daishonin writes: “Myo means to be fully endowed,
which in turn has the meaning of ‘perfect and full” (WND-1, 146):

¢ character myo means to open” (WND-I, 145); and “Myo
Means to revive, that is, to return to life” (WND-1, 149).

4. The unchanging nature inherent in all things and phenomena.

5. The ten directions refers to the entire universe, all physical space.
Specifically, the ten directions are the eight directions of the com-
Pass—north, south, east, west, northwest, northeast, southeast and
southwest—plus up and down. Buddhist scriptures refer to the
existence of Buddha lands in all directions throughout the uni-
verse, each with its own Buddha. The expression the Buddhas of the
ten directions in the sutras indicates these Buddhas. The phrase ten
directions often appears with the phrase three existences, meaning
Past, present and future existences. “The Buddhas of the ten direc-
tions and three existences” thus means all Buddhas throughout
Space and time.

6. Substituting faith for wisdom: The principle that faith is the true
cause for gaining supreme wisdom, and faith alone leads to
enlightenment.

7. Originally inherent mystic truth: The fundamental Law, Mystic
ny or Buddha nature with which all life is originally endowed.

8. Various obstacles and hindrances to the practice of Buddhism that
ppear as a result of one advancing correctly along the path of faith.

9. Nichikan was the twenty-sixth chief priest of Taiseki-ji, the head
temple of the Nikko school (also known as the Fuji school). He is
revered as the restorer of Nichiren’s teachings because he worked to
clarify their true meaning. During the four centuries after Nichiren
