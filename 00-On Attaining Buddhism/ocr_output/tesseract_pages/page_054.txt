writes Nichiren Daishonin. Our hearts, our
minds, are truly wondrous and unfathomable. We
an expand and deepen the inner realm of our

Buddhism finds supreme nobility and the
By catia for great change in all human beings.
In On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime,”
Nichiren, therefore, concludes that when we
thoroughly polish our lives through chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, it is possible for us to
tap the life-state of Buddhahood no matter
how Steeped in delusion we may be, and to

transform even the most impure and evil land
into a pure land.

_ Myoho-renge-kyo is the name of the “mystic
truth that is originally inherent in all living
beings” (WND-1, 3), Accordingly, through the
practice of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, we
can reveal our inner Buddhahood—polishing “the
tarnished mirror of a mind now clouded by the
illusions of the innate darkness of life” into “a clear

‘| is the heart that is important” (“The

mirror reflecting the essential nature of phenom-
ena and the true aspect of reality” (see WND-1, 4).
In other words, by manifesting the mystic truth
that resides within us, we can tap our infinite
inner potential. Buddhahood is the state of life
that is one with Myoho-renge-kyo, the originally
inherent mystic truth. Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is
also the name of this ultimate state of life.

The passage I will discuss this time explains
the relation between Myoho-renge-kyo and the
mind of living beings in terms of the elements of
myo, ho, renge and kyo. This explanation may be
seen as a description of how our lives become
one with Myoho-renge-kyo and manifest the
state of Buddhahood. Let us consider the pro-
found meaning of this passage.

The Mind Is the Mystic Entity of the
Middle Way That Is the Ultimate Reality

Nichiren Daishonin says that myo of Myoho-
renge-kyo signifies the marvelous nature of our
lives from moment to moment. And he uses the
concepts of existence and nonexistence to describe
this wondrous and unfathomable nature.

Our minds are in a state of constant flux,
moving with the ebb and flow of countless
thoughts and emotions. Nichiren notes: “When
we look into our own mind at any moment, we
perceive neither color nor form to verify that it
exists. Yet we still cannot say it does not exist, for
many differing thoughts continually occur. The
mind cannot be considered either to exist or not
to exist. Life is indeed an elusive reality that tran-
scends both the words and concepts of existence
and nonexistence. It is neither existence nor
nonexistence, yet exhibits the qualities of both”
(WND-1, 4).
