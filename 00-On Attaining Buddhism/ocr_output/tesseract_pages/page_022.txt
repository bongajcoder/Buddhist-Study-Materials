On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime

As Nichiren indicates when he says that the
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo he chants for the hap-
piness of self and others toward the realization
of kosen-rufu clears “the clouds of ignorance”
(see “The Doctrine of Three Thousand Realms,”
WND-2, 85), Nam-myoho-renge-kyo truly has
the power to dispel life’s darkness. When we
chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, the sun of Bud-
dhahood rises in our hearts. The ignorance and
delusion, like heavy clouds shrouding the sun,
are swept away. When the sun of Buddhahood
comes to shine within us, the darkness of
ignorance vanishes.

But Nichiren Buddhism is not a teaching in
which Nichiren alone shines like the sun. It is a
teaching in which all of us can bring the sun of
Buddhahood to rise in our lives just as he did. We

In this regard, Nichikan writes: “When one
embraces and has faith in this Gohonzon and

chants Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, one’s life imme-
diately becomes the object of devotion of three
thousand realms in a single life-moment. It
becomes the life of Nichiren Daishonin.’* The
practice of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is
the supreme path to attaining Buddhahood
through which each person can become a shining
sun in his or her own right.

The great nineteenth-century Russian poet
Aleksandr Pushkin sings: “Before the bright
dawn, even so / Shall flicker and die every
sophistry jaded / At reason’s unperishing spark. /
Salute to the sunrise, and vanish the dark!”’

Nichiren Buddhism is the Buddhism of the
sun that opens the path of life’s supreme victory
for all humankind. With “Salute to the sunrise!”
as our rallying cry, let us dynamically advance in
the struggle to dispel the darkness of ignorance in
people’s hearts.

According to this prinapie, all phenomena imhere im a single moment of

Myobo-renge. This sangie Lew that is Myoho-renge encompasses within it
realms, and is lacking m none of them. Anyone who practices this Law will
obtain both the cruse and the effect of Buddhahood simultaneously” (“The
Entity of the Mystic Law,” WND-1,421),

4, True aspect of all phenpmens: The ultimate truth or reality that permeates
ell phenomens and is in no way separate from them. A principle expressed
in “Expedient Means,” the second chapter of the Lotus Suua. In the writ-
ing titled “The True Aspect of All Phenomena Nichiren defined “all
phenomena” as all living beings and their environments in the Ten Worlds,

and “the true aspect” as the Law of Myoho-renge-kyo, the ultimate reality

permeating all living beings and ther environments in any of the Ten
Worlds. All phenomena, he stated, are manifestations of this universal Law:
phenomena and the ultimate truth are inseparable and non-dual. The
“Expedient Means” chapter clarifies the truth that all people are inherently

4 The Ten Worlds are ten distinct realms or categories of beings referred to in
Buddhist scriptures. From the lowest to the highest, the realms of (1) hell,
(2) hungry spirits, (3) animals, (4) asuras, (5) human beings, (6) heavenly
beings, (7) voice-hearers, (8) cause-awakened ones, (9) bodhisattvas and
(10) Buddhas. From the standpoint of the Lotus Sutra, the Ten Worlds indi-
cates ten potential states or conditions that a person can manifest or
experience. Also includes the concept of the nine worlds, which indicates all
the worlds other than Buddhas.

5. Nichiren writes: “Therefore, when once we chant Myoho-renge-kyo, with

just that single sound we summon forth and manifest the Buddha nature of
all Buddhas; all existences; all bodhisattvas; all voice-hearers; all the deities
auch as Brahma, Shakea, and King Yama; the sun and moon, and the myriad
stars; the heavenly gods and earthly deities, on down to hell-dwellers,
hungry spirits, animals, asuras, human and heavenly beings, and all other
living beings. This blessing is immeasurable and boundless” (“How Those
Initially Aspiring to the Way Can Attain Buddhahood through the Lotus
Sutra,” WND-1, 887).
