ment to truth and justice never lose

hope, even amid the greatest hardship or
difficulty. Rather, they serve as a bright beacon
illuminating the darkness of people’s suffering,
imparting inspiration, assurance and courage.

When we change, the world changes. The
key to all change is in our inner transforma-
tion—a change in our hearts and minds. This is
human revolution. We all have the power to
change. When we realize this truth of life, we
can bring forth that power anywhere, anytime
and in any situation.

Nichiren Buddhism, based on the transfor-
mative principles of the Lotus Sutra, has made
this great path of inner change available to
all people, with the chanting of Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo as its core practice.

Nichiren outlines the basic attitude
and approach to our fundamental practice of

Changing Ourselves
and Changing the Land

As I have already touched on at length, the
entirety of Buddhism exists within our own
lives. And the key to attaining Buddhahood—the
ultimate transformation of our life-state—also
lies in a change in our hearts, or minds.

To convey this point, Nichiren Daishonin
here summarizes a point from the Vimalakirti
Sutra:' “When one seeks the Buddhas’ emanci-
pation in the minds of ordinary beings, one

finds that ordinary beings are the entities of
enlightenment, and that the sufferings of birth
and death are nirvana”? (WND-1, 4). ;
“Ordinary beings are the entities of enlight-
enment” means that the wisdom for attaining
Buddhahood (enlightenment) manifests in the
lives of ordinary people steeped in earthly
desires. Similarly, “the sufferings of birth and
death are nirvana” means that the Buddha life-
State of true peace and tranquillity (nirvana)
manifests in the lives of ordinary people tor
mented by the sufferings of birth and death.
Here, Nichiren explains that Buddhas and
ordinary people are not separated by an insur-
mountable divide; that the only thing setting
them apart is the difference in the “minds of
ordinary beings.”

Nichiren also cites the passage from the
Vimalakirti Sutra that explains the difference
between pure and impure lands. This passage—
which Nichiren summarizes as “If the minds of
living beings are impure, their land is also
impure, but if their minds are pure, so is their
land”*—clarifies that there are not two separate
lands; the only difference between pure and
impure lands is “the good or evil of our minds.”
The view shown here is one in which the pure
dand does not exist in some otherworldly realm
but in'the real world, and is achieved by people
changing themselves Inside. This is a dynamic
and practical view of the Pure land, based on
the idea of “to purify Buddha lands” expounded
in the Lotus Sutra (The Lotus Sutra and Its
Opening and Closing Sutras, p. 117),
