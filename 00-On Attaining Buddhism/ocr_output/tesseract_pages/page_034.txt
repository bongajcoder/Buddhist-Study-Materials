Nichiren then cites a passage from a T'ien-t al
school commentary, which states, “Unless one per-
ceives the nature of one’s life, one cannot eradicate
one’s grave offenses” (WND-1, 3-4). If we fail to
grasp this point, Nichiren warns, all of the practices
and good deeds we might perform while seeking
enlightenment outside ourselves will ultimately
become “an endless, painful austerity” (WND-1, 4).
What does it mean to say that unless we per-
ceive the nature of our lives, we cannot eradicate
our grave offenses? “Grave offenses” here can be
taken to indicate fundamental darkness, which is
the source of all evil. The grave offense of slan-
der—denigrating the Law or the correct teaching
In T'ien-t’ai’s Buddhism, it is only possible to
eradicate this ignorance through the practice of
sword of faith in accord with the principle of
“substituting faith for wisdom.”* This is the
essence of the practice of chanting Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo.
us, we are not pursuing the path of “observing
one’s mind,” which enables us to overcome the
fundamental evil of ignorance or darkness. In
that case, all our efforts and good deeds to attain
enlightenment will be lacking the vital ingredient;
they will be every bit as futile as counting a neigh-
bor’s vast riches. Moreover, because none of these
efforts will help us eradicate our ignorance, they
will only become “an endless, painful austerity.”
This battle against ignorance is the heart of
Buddhism. It is said that Shakyamuni’s enlighten-
ment lay in identifying darkness or ignorance as

Therefore, as long as we seek the path to
enlightenment outside our own lives, whatever
practices and good deeds we carry out will deviate
from the true essence of Buddhism. Accordingly,
Nichiren says: “Such students of Buddhism are
condemned as non-Buddhist” (WND-1, 4).

To Seek Enlightenment Outside
Our Lives Is To Be Defeated by
Fundamental Darkness

An important point in this writing is that we as
Nichiren Buddhists also run the risk of falling
into non-Buddhist ways of thinking if we seek the
Law outside of our own lives. Hence, as Nichiren
Daishonin’s disciples, we must always bear in
mind his admonition “You must never think that
any of the [Buddha’s] teachings . . . are outside
yourself” (WND-1, 3).

The chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is a
practice for revealing the “originally inherent
mystic truth” that exists in all people and achiev-
ing Buddhahood in this lifetime. It is an
incomparably “wonderful practice” (OTT, 88), in
the sense that it represents the means by which all
living beings can gain enlightenment.

If, however, we forget Nichiren’s admonition to
never seek the Law outside of us, then no matter
how hard we practice, we will lose sight of the cor-
tect path to universal enlightenment and effectively
wind up practicing a non-Buddhist teaching. That’s
why Nichiren is so strict on this point.

The essence of our practice is to perceive the
true nature of our lives. To do this we must wage
an inner struggle. If we allow ourselves to be
defeated by the three obstacles and four devils,*
we cannot bring forth our enlightenment. That js
