On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime

Key Points

Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo

in Terms of Faith and Practice
In Nichiren Buddhism, chanting Nam-myoho-
renge-kyo has two aspects: the chanting of Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo in terms of faith and chanting in
terms of practice. Chanting in terms of faith refers
to the spiritual aspect of our practice. This essen-
tially consists of the struggle we wage in our hearts
against our inner delusion or darkness—a battle
against the negative and destructive forces within
us. It means that through the power of faith—in
other words, through strengthening our conviction
thus revealing the life-state of Buddhahood. Chant-
ing in terms of practice, meanwhile, refers to
chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo ourselves and
also teaching it to others. It means making efforts in
negativity and illusion. (p. 3)

The Heart ts Most Important

The human heart is sensitive, multifaceted and rich;
it has the capacity for magnificent achievement. For
that very reason, the heart often undergoes great
an endless, downward spiral. Will we transmigrate
forever along the paths of evil, or can we succeed in
directing our lives into an orbit of good? As evi-
denced in many of his writings, Nichiren repeatedly
stresses the crucial importance of the heart, or
for dramatic shifts from evil to good or from good
to evil. That is why Nichiren’s teaching of enlighten-
ment can be viewed as a process that begins with
inner change. In other words, through the power of
faith, we can defeat the negative functions inside us
that are governed by the fundamental darkness in all
human hearts and manifest the positive functions
of life that are one with the Dharma nature—our
Buddhahood. (p. 5)

A Humanistic,
People-centered Religion

Nichiren had deep insight into the potential of
human beings, discerning that they could free them-
selves from a cycle of negative transmigration and
realize a positive one through profound inner
change. And he set forth a practical way to enable all
people to achieve this. Consequently, there is no
other teaching that can more deservedly be called
humanistic than Nichiren Buddhism. In “The True
Aspect of All Phenomena,” Nichiren writes:
“Though it is thought that Shakyamuni Buddha
possesses the three virtues of sovereign, teacher, and
parent for the sake of all of us living beings, that is
not so. On the contrary, it is common mortals who
endow him with the three virtues” (WND-1, 384).
This passage describes a shift from an authoritarian
to a humanistic, people-centered religion. The
teaching of Nichiren, who established the concrete
means for achieving enlightenment in this lifetime,
makes this shift possible. (p. 7)

The Fundamental Purpose of Our Lives
Only by winning over our inner darkness and neg-
ativity can we be victorious in life and reveal our
full potential. The same is true if we wish to savor
true fulfillment. Allow me to emphasize, then, that
the Nichiren Buddhist practice toward attaining
Buddhahood in this lifetime is the only means to
conquer the darkness and delusion that are the
fundamental source of human evil, and cultivate
true independence. It allows us to construct a solid
self, and achieve a state of life of boundless happi-
ness and peace of mind. Attaining Buddhahood in
this lifetime thus becomes the fundamental pur-
pose of an individual’s life. (p. 8)

Changing the Destiny of All Humanity
The only way for human beings to change is for
them to conquer their inner darkness and redis-
cover the eternal dignity within their own lives.
Cultivating the noble spirit with which all people
are originally endowed will directly lead to a change
in the destiny of humankind. With that conviction,
we of the SGI have been working to build a network
of good all around the globe. (p. 9)
