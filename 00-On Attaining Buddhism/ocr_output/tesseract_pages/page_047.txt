reality. Arouse deep faith, and diligently polish
your mirror day and night. How should you
polish it? Only by chanting Nam-myoho-renge-

The mirror simile here is truly ingenious.
The mirror being endowed with the property
of reflection corresponds to our lives being
endowed with the mystic truth. But if a mirror is
not polished, it will naturally become clouded.
Since mirrors in Nichiren’s day were typically
made of bronze, they would readily tarnish. A
tarnished mirror could not fulfill its original
function, so it had to be polished regularly.
Similarly, if our lives are neglected and left
uncultivated, they will be shrouded in ignorance.

The act of polishing is indispensable for
restoring the mirror’s innate property. More-

enough. We have to keep polishing it if we wish
it to retain its reflective property. As this
metaphor aptly attests, our practice of chanting

our lives, thereby wiping away the dust of
ignorance and heightening the brilliance of our
enlightened Dharma nature.

This practice of polishing our lives may be
seen as having two aspects. One is to “arouse
deep faith,” as Nichiren exhorts (WND-1, 4).
This could also be articulated as summoning
the fighting spirit to battle our inner darkness.
The other aspect is to continue making stead-
fast efforts, in accord with Nichiren’s
admonition that we should “diligently polish
our mirror day and night” (see WND-1, 4).

These two points echo the two aspects of
chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo identified
by Nichikan, a seventeenth-century restorer of
Nichiren Buddhism, based on the phrase in
the “Expedient Means” chapter of the Lotus
Sutra, “exert oneself bravely and vigorously”
(see LSOC, 56; Jpn yumyo shojin). Nichikan
explains that “bravely and vigorously” (yumyo)
