The Profound Meaning of
Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo

“On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime” is
an important writing that clarifies the basic
theory and practice of Nichiren Buddhism. SGI
members throughout the globe have deepened
their understanding of the essence of Nichiren
Daishonin’s teachings by earnestly studying this
writing as a guideline for practice and study.

Although the original is no longer extant and
the precise date and name of the recipient are
unknown, this letter is traditionally thought to
have been written around 1255 and addressed to
Toki Jonin.' The assertion that it was composed
in 1255, shortly after Nichiren publicly declared
his teaching of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo in 1253, is
credible in view of the letter’s content, explaining
as it does the significance of chanting Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo in terms of both theory and
practice.

The practice of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-
kyo is the foundation of Nichiren’s lifetime of
teachings. Nichiren Buddhism, unlike the estab-
lished Buddhist schools of his day, was not
dedicated to the worship of a specific god or Bud-
dha. Nichiren established the means for all people
to achieve enlightenment, the ideal of the Lotus
Sutra, by formulating the practice of chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, which enables us to acti-
vate our inherent Buddha nature and manifest it
as the life-state of Buddhahood,

In Nichiren Buddhism, chanting Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo has two aspects; the chanting
of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo in terms of faith and
chanting in terms of practice, Chanting in terms
of faith refers to the spiritual aspect of our prac-
tice. This essentially consists of the struggle we
wage in our hearts against our inner delusion or

darkness—a battle against the negative and
destructive forces within us. It means that
through the power of faith—in other words,
through strengthening our conviction that we
possess the Buddha nature—we can break
through the darkness obscuring this awareness,
thus revealing the life-state of Buddhahood.
Chanting in terms of practice, meanwhile, refers
to chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo ourselves
and also teaching it to others. It means making
efforts in word and deed for our own and others’
happiness in the course of our spiritual struggle
against inner negativity and illusion.

When we chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, we
are both chanting the name of, and calling forth,
the Buddha nature in our own lives and the lives
of others. Through applying our practice of faith
to win over doubt and delusion, the power of our
inherent Buddha nature is called forth by the
sound of our chanting and spontaneously mani-
fests in our lives.*

The key point that sets Nichiren Buddhism
apart from the other Buddhist schools of his day
was the establishment of this concrete means
for attaining Buddhahood. And from the time he
first declared Nam-myoho-renge-kyo until the
moment of his death, Nichiren ardently strove to
teach this supreme path of enlightenment to peo-
ple throughout the land.

In the opening passage of “On Attaining Bud-
dhahood in This Lifetime,” Nichiren clearly and
fully articulates the basic philosophy of enlight-
enment that lies at the heart of his teaching,
which exists for the happiness of all humanity: “If
you wish to free yourself from the sufferings of
birth and death you have endured since time
without beginning and to attain without fail
unsurpassed enlightenment in this lifetime, you
must perceive the mystic truth that is originally
