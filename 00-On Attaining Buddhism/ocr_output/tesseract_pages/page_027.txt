Summoning Forth and Manifesting
the Buddha Nature

The Mystic Law is the fundamental law of the
universe. Its universality transcends our individ-
ual selves. As indicated by its description as the
“mystic truth that is originally inherent in all liv-
ing beings,” however, the Mystic Law also exists
within our lives (“On Attaining Buddhahood in
This Lifetime,” WND-1, 3). It both resides within
us and transcends us. Put another way, the Mystic
Law is inherent in our lives because it is the all-

the Buddhas of the three existences, are one and
identical. This principle is called Myoho-renge-
kyo” (WND-1, 887).

Not only is Myoho-renge-kyo our own Bud-
dha nature, he says, but it is also the Buddha
nature of all heavenly deities, voice-hearers,
bodhisattvas and so on. Moreover, this Buddha
nature is identical to the Mystic Law to which the
Buddhas of the three existences—past, present
and future—are enlightened.

Nichiren then goes on to explain that the
chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is a practice
in which we “summon forth and manifest” the
Buddha nature inherent in the lives of all beings of
the Ten Worlds: “Therefore, when once we chant
