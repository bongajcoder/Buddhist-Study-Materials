The Vimalakirti Sutra states that, when one seeks the Buddhas’ emancipation
in the minds of ordinary beings, one finds that ordinary beings are the entities
of enlightenment, and that the sufferings of birth and death are nirvana. It

also states that, if the minds of living beings are impure, their land is also

impure, but if their minds are pure, so is their land. There are not two lands,
solely in the good or evil of

pure or impure in themselves. The difference lies
our minds,

It is the same with a Buddha and an ordinary being. When deluded, one is
called an ordinary being, but when enlightened, one is called a Buddha. This
is similar to a tarnished mirror that will shine like a jewel when polished. A
mind now clouded by the illusions of the innate darkness of life is like a tar-
nished mirror, but when polished, it is sure t become like a clear mirror,
reflecting the essential nature of phenomena lie. the Dharma nature] and the
true aspect of reality, Arouse deep faith, and diligently polish your mirror day
and night. How should you polish it? Only by chanting Nam-myoho-renge-

kyo, (“On Attaining Buddhahood in This L ifetime,” The Writings of Nichiren Daishonin, vol. 1, p. 4)
