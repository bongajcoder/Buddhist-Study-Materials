myoho-renge-kyo allows us to manifest this

innate mystic truth.

italics in these passages):

The five characters of Myoho-renge-
kyo do not represent the sutra text, nor
are they its meaning. They are nothing
other than the intent of the entire
Sutra. So, even though the beginners in
Buddhist practice may not understand
their significance, by practicing these
five characters, they will naturally con-
form to the sutra’s intent. (“On the
Four Stages of Faith and the Five
Stages of Practice” WND-1, 788)

If we do not harbor doubts in our
hearts, we will as a matter of course
attain Buddhahood. (“The Opening of
the Eyes,” WND-1, 283)

Because Myoho-renge-kyo is the inherent
Law of life to which the Buddha became
enlightened, chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo
represents an unerring practice for us to gain
enlightenment. Hence, Nichiren says, “You are
certain to attain Buddhahood in this lifetime”

(WND-1, 4):

—_—

We may call it the most natural path, how-
ever, that does not mean that we do not have to
make personal effort. As with any path, in order
to enable many people to follow it, the way has
to be opened, obstructions must be removed
and a clear pathway must be trodden. Similarly,
the path of chanting entails a struggle to
maintain faith that Myoho-renge-kyo exists
within us and to defeat the fundamental dark-
ness inherent in our lives.

When we embrace the five characters of
Myoho-renge-kyo, we can positively transform
the cycles of negativity, delusion and suffering
that our lives have repeatedly undergone as 4
result of innate darkness or ignorance. We can
naturally engrave deep within us the causality
for attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime.

Here, faith is the cause, and manifesting
the life-state of Buddhahood is the effect.
“To engrave the causality for attaining Bud-
dhahood deep in our lives,” therefore, is to
vanquish through faith the inner darkness that
is the source of evil and misery, and to bring
the rhythm of Myoho-renge-kyo, the inherent
mystic truth, to pulse vibrantly in our lives. The
life-state of Buddhahood is perfectly in tune
with this rhythm of Myoho-renge-kyo.

Through chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo,
the causality of Buddhahood will come to sup-
plant the causality of negativity that has existed
in our lives. And when we forge strong faith
that is impervious to any attack of fundamen-
tal darkness or devilish functions, the causality
for attaining Buddhahood takes root in the
very core of our beings.

Faith, therefore, is absolutely crucial, That is
why Nichiren underscores the importance of
having “deep faith” in sharing the principle that
our lives are entities of the Mystic Law (see
