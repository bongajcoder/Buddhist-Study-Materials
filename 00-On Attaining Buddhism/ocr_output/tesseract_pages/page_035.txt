why battling the darkness or ignorance within us
is an unavoidable part of the process of becoming
a Buddha. In other words, whether we continu-
ously battle our innate ignorance is the single
most important determinant in whether we
attain Buddhahood. As such, it is something we
must never forget.

By engaging in this struggle, we can reveal the
Buddha wisdom within our lives and thereby
confront and overcome our ignorance. But if we
fail to undertake this struggle, ignorance will
shroud and conceal our Buddha nature. Igno-
rance deepens and exacerbates the five delusive
inclinations of greed, anger, foolishness, arro-
gance and doubt within us. That is what happens
if we succumb to the erroneous view that the Law
is outside ourselves.

Faith for Attaining
Buddhahood in This Lifetime

Naturally, the Gohonzon—the object of devotion
in Nichiren Buddhism—in itself is great beyond
measure. A passage from Nichikan’s Six-Volume
Writings? that states: “Even someone who has not
yet aroused true faith will still receive immense
benefit through connecting with the correct
object [of devotion, namely, the Gohonzon]”
(Rokkansho, p. 81).

The true lineage of faith we inherit in the Soka
Gakkai is what opens up this infinite and bound-
less power of the Gohonzon. Faith as practiced by
the Soka Gakkai entails an active struggle to man-
ifest the Mystic Law in our lives; it also produces
clear actual proof of benefit. When we advance
together with the Soka Gakkai, we naturally come

to internalize the correct practice of faith as
taught by Nichiren Daishonin.

Therefore, those who sincerely chant Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo to the Gohonzon and practice
and participate in activities with the Soka Gakkai
cannot fail to become Buddhas. The purpose of
faith is to freely realize our full potential and shine
in our own unique way. That’s why it’s important
to keep advancing and challenging ourselves, to
have the spirit “I will exert myself in my practice! I
will deepen my faith! I will do my best as a mem-
ber of the Soka Gakkai.” This is the certain path to
attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime.

With this understanding, let’s concretely and
strictly apply to our daily practice Nichiren’s
admonition “If you think the Law is outside your-
self, you are embracing not the Mystic Law but an
inferior teaching” (WND-1, 3). To seek the Mystic
Law somewhere outside of us essentially amounts
to evading responsibility for our own lives.

Practicing Nichiren Buddhism means not
being swayed this way and that; it means con-
structing a self that is solid and resolute like
towering Mount Fuji. But if we neglect this task
and focus our energies somewhere else, before
we're even aware of it, we can end up veering onto
the path of externally seeking the Law.

For example, if we chant to the Gohonzon but
always blame other people or our environment
for our circumstances, we are avoiding the chal-
lenge of tackling our inner darkness or ignorance.
By doing so, we are seeking enlightenment out-
side of us. By changing ourselves on a more
profound level, we can begin to improve our situ-
ation. Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is the
driving force for that change.

It is also important that we don’t fall into the
