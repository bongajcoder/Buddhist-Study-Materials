On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime

Emphasis on Inner Change

Therefore, when you chant myoho and recite renge, you must summon up deep
faith that Myoho-renge-kyo is your life itself. (wwp-1, 3)

Arouse deep faith, and diligently polish your mirror day and night. How
‘should you polish it? Only by chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. (WwND-1, 4)

n “On Attaining Buddhahood in This Life-
a profound change in our lives, in our hearts and
minds.
of the mutually inclusive relationship of a single
moment of life and all phenomena” (WND-1, 3).
What this means is that our lives or our minds at
each moment both embody all phenomena and
pervade all phenomena. This could be described as
a life-state of oneness with the universe.

Also, Nichiren warns that if we seek the Mystic
Law outside ourselves, then no matter how much
we chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, we cannot
manifest the condition of enlightenment; on the
contrary, our Buddhist practice will only “become
an endless, painful austerity” (WND-1, 4), He
clearly states: “Even though you chant and believe
in Myoho-renge-kyo, if you think the Law is out-
side yourself, you are embracing not the Mystic
Law but an inferior teaching” (WND-1, 3).

Nichiren explains that the key to chanting
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is summoning up deep
faith, or confidence, in the existence of our innate
Buddhahood. He declares that when we do so, we
can polish our lives and reveal our enlightenment,
writing: “Therefore, when you chant myoho and
tecite renge [that is, chant Nam-myoho-renge-
kyo], you must summon up deep faith that
Myoho-renge-kyo is your life itself (literally,
your mind at each moment]” (WND-1, 3). He
continues: “Arouse deep faith, and diligently
polish your mirror day and night. How should you
polish it? Only by chanting Nam-myoho-renge-
kyo” (WND-1, 4).

In addition, Nichiren speaks of “the mystic
entity of the Middle Way that is the ultimate
reality” (WND-1, 4)—in other words, the mystic,
inscrutable nature of life, of our hearts and
minds, that manifests as Buddhahood. Here, he
indicates that Myoho-renge-kyo is the wonderful
law of life, of the inner realm of our beings.
On that basis, he asserts that when we chant
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo with deep faith in the
