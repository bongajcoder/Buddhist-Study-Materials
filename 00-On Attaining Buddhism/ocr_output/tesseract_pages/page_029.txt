second Soka Gakkai president, described the infi-
nite power of the Mystic Law as follows: “It is like
lying sprawled on your back in a wide-open space
looking up at the sky, All that you wish for imme-
diately appears. No matter how much you may
give away, there is always more. It is never
exhausted. Try and see if you can attain this state
of life.”

Indeed, Nam-myoho-renge-kyo can be likened
to a “wish-granting jewel.” How can we develop the
boundless state of life that enables us to bring forth
whatever strength is necessary? President Toda
often used to say, “If you really want to achieve such
a state of life, you have to fight with every ounce of
your being for the Lotus Sutra, for kosen-rufu!”

Such was the vast and untrammeled spirit of
my mentor: the spirit to strive forever together
with the Buddhas of the three existences and with
the life-affirming functions of the universe such
as Brahma and Shakra, wherever in the universe
we might find ourselves; the spirit to actualize a
world of happiness and peace dedicated to value
creation, by helping people overcome misery and
misfortune and the sufferings of birth, aging,
sickness and death.

Throughout everything, Mr. Toda steadfastly
continued to seek the Law that exists nowhere
but within our own lives. And he stressed the
importance of living true to oneself. His starting
point was his profound realization in prison that
the Buddha is life itself and his awakening to his
identity as a Bodhisattva of the Earth.

He also often spoke of the spirit of faith
we need in order to perceive the Mystic Law with-
in us, saying: “You have to be resolved that
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is your own life!” or

means firmly believing that your life is nothing
apart from Nam-myoho-renge-kyo!” This is the
spirit Nichiren teaches in the passage, “When you
chant myoho and recite renge, you must summon
up deep faith that Myoho-renge-kyo is your life
itself” (“On Attaining Buddhahood in This Life-
time,” WND-1, 3).

A Universal Religion for the
Happiness of All Humankind

Generally speaking, religions expound some infi-
nite and eternal entity that transcends both human
beings and the impermanence of this world, using
such terms as God or law. Different religions regard
this infinite and eternal entity variously as a source
of fear and awe, an object of adoration, a great void
of emptiness or a wellspring of all-embracing love.

Nichiren Daishonin saw the power of the
Mystic Law that encompasses and sustains all
things in the universe as existing within human
beings, and he established a means for actually
manifesting that Law in their lives.

During my second lecture at Harvard Univer-
sity (in September 1993), | proposed three areas
where Mahayana Buddhism could contribute to
modern civilization: (1) in fostering the creation
of peace; (2) in paving the way toward the restora-
tion and rejuvenation of humanity; and (3) in
providing a philosophical basis for the symbiotic
coexistence of all things. In connection with the
second point, I stressed the important significance
of the approach of Nichiren Buddhism, which
teaches neither an exclusive reliance on the “power
of self” nor on the “power of other.” This perspec-
tive has resonated deeply with many scholars.
