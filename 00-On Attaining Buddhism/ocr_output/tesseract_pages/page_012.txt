On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime

journey to become a resplendent, godlike Buddha;
it is about accomplishing a transformation in the
depths of one’s being. This revolutionary view
of enlightenment fundamentally changed the
meaning of Buddhist practice from how it was
traditionally viewed.

In other words, it is not a matter of practicing in
order to scale the highest summit of enlightenment
at some point in the distant future. Rather, it is
a constant, moment-to-moment, inner struggle
between revealing our innate Dharma nature or
allowing ourselves to be ruled by our fundamental
darkness and delusion. This unceasing effort to pol-
ish our lives is the essence of Buddhist practice.

Only by winning over our inner darkness
and negativity can we be victorious in life and
reveal our full potential. The same is true if we
wish to savor true fulfillment. Allow me to
emphasize, then, that the Nichiren Buddhist
practice toward attaining Buddhahood in this
lifetime is the only means to conquer the dark-
ness and delusion that are the fundamental
source of human evil, and cultivate true inde-
pendence. It allows us to construct a solid self,
and achieve a state of life of boundless happi-
ness and peace of mind. Attaining Buddhahood
in this lifetime thus becomes the fundamental
purpose of an individual’s life.

g Budd ida hahood for Humanity

The Lotus Sutra is the king of sutras, the direct path to enlightenment, for it
explains that the entity of our life, which manifests either good or evil at each
moment, is in fact the entity of the Mystic Law.

If you chant Myoho-renge-kyo with deep faith in this principle, you are
certain to attain Buddhahood in this lifetime. That is why the sutra states,
“After I have passed into extinction, {one] should accept and uphold this sutra.
Such a person assuredly and without doubt will attain the Buddha way.” Never

doubt in the slightest. (wxp-i, 4)

in this lifetime is significant in that it offers

a source of hope to humanity and opens the
way to transforming the destiny of all humankind.
This is its collective or universal significance.

Many leading thinkers and intellectuals recog-
nize that moder civilization has lost sight of the
human being and become deadlocked on many
fronts. There is no denying that the inner spiritual

realm has been neglected and all too many people
are obsessed with seeking comfort, ease and pleasure
in external things—things outside of themselves.
Without surmounting the fundamental human
delusions of greed, anger and foolishness, we can-
not solve the many problems that the world faces
today, including the preoccupation with economic
growth, politics that are devoid of humanism,
international conflicts, warfare, growing disparity
