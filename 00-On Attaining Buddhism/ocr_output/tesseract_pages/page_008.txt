by manifesting within us the mystic truth inher-
ent in all living beings, we can free ourselves from
the endless sufferings of birth and death. The
name of that mystic truth is Myoho-renge-kyo,

The Significance of Our Existence as Human Beings

Nevertheless, even though you chant and believe in Myoho-renge-kyo, if you
think the Law is outside yourself, you are embracing not the Mystic Law but

an inferior teaching. (\vD-1, 3)

he concept of attaining Buddhahood in
ik lifetime refers to ordinary people

becoming enlightened during the course
of their present existences. By extension, it means
that they can achieve this just as they are. As such,
attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime means
the same thing as attaining Buddhahood in one’s
present form, which is the Lotus Sutra’s approach
to Buddhahood and illustrated by the example
of the dragon king’s daughter’ in the sutra’s
“Devadatta” chapter.

Lotus Sutra teachings, which expound that one
can become enlightened only after practicing
austerities over countless lifetimes, Because the

life-state of Buddhahood is at one with the eter-
nal Mystic Law and abounds with infinite wisdom
and compassion, it tended to be seen as some-
thing completely separate and removed from the
lives of ordinary people steeped in illusion.
Attaining enlightenment was thought to require
overcoming the unfathomably deep chasm
between the spiritual states of a Buddha and ordi-
nary people, and this gave rise to the idea that it
was necessary to carry out austere practices for
innumerable kalpas.*

Nichiren Buddhism clarifies that it is specifi-
cally in this present existence, in which we have
been born as human beings, that we can actualize
the principle of attaining Buddhahood in one’s
