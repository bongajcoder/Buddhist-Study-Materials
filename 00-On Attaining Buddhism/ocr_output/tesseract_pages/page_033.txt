he character myo of myoho, or “Mystic
[ue has three meanings: to be fully
endowed, to open and to revive.’ These
three meanings are all implicit in chanting Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo. In other words, the chanting
of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo contains (1) the myo
of perfect endowment—meaning that the single
Law of Myoho-renge-kyo encompasses all phe-
nomena; (2) the myo of transformation that
“opens” the world of Buddhahood in the lives of
beings in the nine worlds (the worlds from hell
through bodhisattva); and (3) the myo of great
benefit, whereby a life filled with suffering is
“revived” as a life of great tranquillity and joy.
Our lives themselves are entities of the Mystic
Law. Therefore, they are fully endowed with all
phenomena. Fundamental darkness and the
enlightened Dharma nature,‘ earthly desires and
enlightenment, and the nine worlds and the world
of Buddhahood—all of these exist within us. For
precisely that reason, we can carry out a mystic
and fundamental inner “revolution”—changing
darkness into light; kindling the flame of enlight-
enment by “burning the firewood of earthly
desires” (The Record of the Orally Transmitted
Teachings, p. 11) and thereby manifesting the world
of Buddhahood in our lives of the nine worlds.
The key to achieving this profound inner
transformation is our hearts—our fundamental
attitude or mind-set. Therefore, Nichiren Dai-
shonin warns in “On Attaining Buddhahood in
This Lifetime”: “If you think the Law is outside
yourself, you are embracing not the Mystic Law
but an inferior teaching” (WND-1, 3). When we
diligently exert ourselves in chanting Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo based on this admonition,
always remembering that a change in our own
hearts or minds is crucial, the three meanings of
myo will clearly manifest themselves in our lives.

Needless to say, the Law contained in the prac-
tice of chanting spread by Nichiren is truly
wondrous. But even the power of this wondrous
Law cannot fully manifest in a life clouded by
ignorance. Ignorance is the inner darkness that
prevents us from believing in the Mystic Law and
staying focused on our own Buddha nature and
that of others. The practice of chanting enables us
to break through this darkness and vibrantly
bring forth our Buddhahood. Battling our funda-
mental darkness—this inner struggle is the
essence of chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.

Studying Buddhism Yet Succumbing
to Non-Buddhist Thinking

In the passage we are studying this time, Nichiren
Daishonin strongly cautions: “You must never
think that any of the eighty thousand sacred
teachings of Shakyamuni Buddha's lifetime or any
of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas of the ten direc-
tions and three existences are outside yourself”
(WND-1, 3). The use of the word never here is
deeply significant. This passage explains that the
entirety of Buddhism is contained within our own
lives. Nichiren concludes that “the eighty thou-
sand sacred teachings of Shakyamuni Buddha's
lifetime” and “the Buddhas and bodhisattvas of
the ten directions and three existences”® are all
phenomena inherent within us.

Nichiren goes on to say that as long as we seek
enlightenment outside ourselves, even our per-
forming “ten thousand practices and ten
thousand good deeds” (meaning all of the prac-
tices expounded in Shakyamuni’s lifetime
teachings) and believing in the protection of the
Buddhas and bodhisattvas throughout the three
existences (meaning the benevolent functions of
