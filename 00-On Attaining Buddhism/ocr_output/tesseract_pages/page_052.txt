Polishing Our Lives Through
Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo

al living beings are inherently entities of the
ystic Law, And inherently, the life-state of Bud-
ahood enables us to tap the limitless power of
€ Mystic Law within us freely and without hin-
Tance, whenever and in whatever form it is
Needed. Nichiren likens this supreme state of life
to a clear mirror that shines like a jewel. Yet even
though we are an entity of the Mystic Law, we
cannot bring forth the power of that Law if our
lives are shrouded in ignorance. In such a
benighted state, we are like a “tarnished mirror”
that will not reflect anything. Chanting Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo is the practice for polishing the
tarnished mirror of our lives. (p. 39)

Arousing Deep Faith
and Making Continual Efforts

The act of polishing is indispensable for restoring
the mirror’s innate property. Moreover, just polish-
ing a mirror once is not enough. We have to keep
polishing it if we wish it to retain its reflective prop-
erty. As this metaphor aptly attests, our practice of
chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is a struggle to
polish our lives, thereby wiping away the dust of
ignorance and heightening the brilliance of our
enlightened Dharma nature. This practice of pol-
ishing our lives may be seen as having two aspects.
One is to “arouse deep faith,” as Nichiren exhorts
(WND-1, 4). This could also be articulated as sum-
moning the fighting spirit to battle our inner
darkness. The other aspect is to continue making
steadfast efforts, in accord with Nichiren’s admoni-
tion that we should “diligently polish our mirror
day and night” (see WND-1, 4). (p. 40)

Nam-myoho-renge-kyo
Is a Diligent Practice

Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is a diligent practice.
Arousing deep faith and steadfastly continuing
to chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo truly requires
constant and unflagging exertion. Persevering
single-mindedly and consistently in this practice
will lead us to attain Buddhahood in this lifetime.
Through such efforts, our inherent Buddha-
hood—the Buddha eternally endowed with the
three bodies—wells forth in the form of inex-
haustible courage, perseverance, joy, wisdom and
compassion. (p. 43)
