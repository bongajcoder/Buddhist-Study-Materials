the great treasure storehouse that brings good
fortune and happiness to all. The important thing
is to live out our lives based on and completely in
sync with the Law; it is to imbue and solidify our
lives with the Mystic Law.

Our daily realities are filled with an endless
succession of problems. But with the firm belief
that our lives are Myoho-renge-kyo, we should
strive to boldly challenge everything with the
unwavering conviction that we can overcome all
hardships and become happy without fail. When
we maintain deep faith based on the foundation
that “I am Myoho-renge-kyo,” we can take on any
problem with courage. The key to victory in life
lies in whether we can bring forth courage. Not a
shrinking timidity but a challenging courage—
this is what we need to have!

Irrespective of the obstacles we may encounter
in the course of our practice, we must not retreat
a single step. We must not be alarmed or startled
by them. The power of the Mystic Law (Myoho-

ing our environment are to believe that the Law is
outside our own lives. So is losing confidence in
turning to others in the hope that they will save
us, or blaming others for our problems, or giving
in to hopelessness and resignation.

When difficulties beset us, no matter how try-
ing they may be, we must clearly see them for the
obstacles or devilish functions they are and battle
against them without retreating. This is the way
of life of those who chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo
and dedicate their lives to the Mystic Law.
Nichiren Daishonin says, “[My] disciples cannot
accomplish anything if they are cowardly” (“The
Teaching, Practice, and Proof,” WND-1, 481). In

On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime

accord with these words, let’s cast aside cowardice
and make courage our foremost attribute.

People of courageous faith can break through
the dark clouds of fear, ignorance and delusion to
bring the sun of the Mystic Law to shine and
beautiful flowers of Myoho-renge—the lotus of
the Mystic Law—to bloom in their lives.

President Toda gave the following guidance to
young women’s division members in the pioneer-
ing days of our movement: “You should take
pride in possessing the same life as the Buddha of
the Latter Day. Win in life with a noble spirit. You
must absolutely never depreciate yourselves.”

Nichiren Buddhism starts from the realization
that the supreme life-condition of Buddhahood
exists in each of us. It is a teaching that makes it
possible for us to achieve the profoundest inner
transformation—a transformation of our funda-
mental attitude or mind-set. That’s why Nichiren
emphasizes the importance of our minds, of
what's in our hearts.

He writes: “Whether you chant the Buddha's
name, recite the sutra, or merely offer flowers and
incense, all your virtuous acts will implant benefits
and roots of goodness in your life. With this convic-
tion you should strive in faith” (WND-1, 4). All our
efforts in faith—including our practice of reciting
the Lotus Sutra and chanting Nam-myoho-renge-
kyo each morning and evening, as well as all of our
various Soka Gakkai activities—are virtuous acts
that “implant benefits and roots of goodness” in
our lives. Those who advance with this deep aware-
ness will be true victors who travel the direct path
to attaining Buddhahood in this lifetime.

Always upholding the great philosophy
embodied in Nichiren’s words “It is the heart that
is important” (WND-1, 1000), let us lead magnif-
icent, victorious lives!
