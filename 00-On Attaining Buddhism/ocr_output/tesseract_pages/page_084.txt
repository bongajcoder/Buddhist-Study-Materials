or fifth, chapter. This chapter describes the
exchange between Vimalakirti, an outstanding
Buddhist lay believer and practitioner of the
bodhisattva way who has fallen ill, and Manju-
shri, one of Shakyamuni’s leading disciples, who
is visiting him. When asked the cause of his
illness, Vimalakirti replies, “Because all living
beings are sick, therefore I am sick.”* This is a
well-known passage that succinctly reveals the
fundamental bodhisattva spirit of taking on
others’ sufferings as one’s own.

Vimalakirti goes on to say that bodhisattvas
choose to be born among living beings afflicted
by delusion and to share in the sufferings of
birth and death in order to instruct and guide
those living beings to enlightenment. More-
over, bodhisattvas are never overwhelmed or
swayed by suffering, because they have estab-
lished a pure state of enlightenment within.’

Thus, the passages from the Vimalakirti
Sutra cited by Nichiren clarify the meaning of
Buddhahood and the pure land from the stand-
point of a bodhisattva practitioner fighting
amid the realities of daily life. Nichiren, there-
fore, states in conclusion, “When deluded, one
is called an ordinary being, but when enlight-
ened, one is called a Buddha” (WND-1, 4). In
other words, the difference between ordinary
people and Buddhas is nothing more than the
difference between delusion and enlightenment
in ordinary people’s minds. How, then, can we

transform delusion into enlightenment?

In the preceding passage, Nichiren explains
that when people’s hearts change, the land or
their external environment can also change. At
its foundation is a transformation from delu-
sion to enlightenment.

As discussed earlier, what makes this trans-
formation possible is the practice of chanting

Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and, on a spiritual
level, faith. Simply put, through faith we can
overcome the ignorance or darkness that is the
root of delusion and manifest the Buddhahood
with which we are originally endowed.

Here, Nichiren uses an analogy to describe
this fundamental potential for change, saying,
“This is similar to a tarnished mirror that will
shine like a jewel when polished” (WND-1, 4).
In this way, he conveys that the practice of
chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo—the means
for defeating our inner darkness—serves to
“polish” our lives.

All living beings are inherently entities of the
Mystic Law. And inherently, the life-state of Bud-
dhahood enables us to tap the limitless power of
the Mystic Law within us freely and without hin-
drance, whenever and in whatever form it is
needed. Nichiren likens this supreme state of life
to a clear mirror that shines like a jewel. Yet even
though we are an entity of the Mystic Law, we
cannot bring forth the power of that Law if our
lives are shrouded in ignorance. In such a
benighted state, we are like a “tarnished mirror”
that will not reflect anything. Chanting Nam-
myoho-renge-kyo is the practice for polishing
the tarnished mirror of our lives.

The Path for Polishing Our Lives:
(1) Brave Challenge

Nichiren Daishonin says with regard to chant-
ing as a practice for polishing our lives: “A mind
now clouded by the illusions of the innate dark-
ness of life is like a tarnished mirror, but when
polished, it is sure to become like a clear mirror,
reflecting the essential nature of phenomena
[ie., the Dharma nature] and the true aspect of
