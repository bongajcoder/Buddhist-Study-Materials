The Significance of Attaining Buddhahood for Humanity
The Lotus Sutra is the king of sutras, the direct path to enlightenment, for it
explains that the entity of our life, which manifests either good or evil at each
moment, is in fact the entity of the Mystic Law.
If you chant Myoho-renge-kyo with deep faith in this principle, you are
certain to attain Buddhahood in this lifetime. That is why the sutra states,
"After I have passed into extinction, [one] should accept and uphold this sutra.
Such a person assuredly and without doubt will attain the Buddha way." Never

Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo To Perceive the Mystic Truth
and Establish the Buddhism of the People
The Lotus Sutra is the king of sutras, true and correct in both word and prin-
ciple. Its words are the ultimate reality, and this reality is the Mystic Law
(myoho). It is called the Mystic Law because it reveals the principle of the
mutually inclusive relationship of a single moment of life and all phenomena.
That is why this sutra is the wisdom of all Buddhas.
Life at each moment encompasses the body and mind and the self and
environment of all sentient beings in the Ten Worlds as well as all insentient
beings in the three thousand realms, including plants, sky, earth, and even
the minutest particles of dust. Life at each moment permeates the entire realm
of phenomena and is revealed in all phenomena. To be awakened to this
principle is itself the mutually inclusive relationship of life at each moment

Transforming Our Fundamental Attitude—
Refusing To Live an "Endless, Painful Austerity"
·. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v. v.
You must never think that any of the eighty thousand sacred teachings of
Shakyamuni Buddha's lifetime or any of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas of the
ten directions and three existences are outside yourself. Your practice of the
Buddhist teachings will not relieve you of the sufferings of birth and death in
the least unless you perceive the true nature of your life. If you seek enlighten-
ment outside yourself, then your performing even ten thousand practices and
ten thousand good deeds will be in vain. It is like the case of a poor man who
spends night and day counting his neighbor's wealth but gains not even half a
coin. That is why the T'ien-t'ai school's commentary states, "Unless one per-
ceives the nature of one's life, one cannot eradicate one's grave offenses."1 This
passage implies that, unless one perceives the nature of one's life, one's prac-
tice will become an endless, painful austerity. Therefore, such students of
Buddhism are condemned as non-Buddhist. [T'ien-t'ai's] Great Concentration
and Insight states that, although they study Buddhism, their views are no dif-
ferent from those of non-Buddhists.
Whether you chant the Buddha's name,2 recite the sutra, or merely offer
flowers and incense, all your virtuous acts will implant benefits and roots of
goodness in your life. With this conviction, you should strive in faith. ("On
Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime," The Writings of Nichiren Daishonin, vol. 1, pp. 3-4)

On Attaining
Buddhahood
In This Lifetime

The Mystic Nature of Our Lives-
"Become the Master of Your Mind
Rather Than Let Your Mind Master You"
·····································
What then does myo signify? It is simply the mysterious nature of our life from
moment to moment, which the mind cannot comprehend or words express.
When we look into our own mind at any moment, we perceive neither color
nor form to verify that it exists. Yet we still cannot say it does not exist, for
many differing thoughts continually occur. The mind cannot be considered
either to exist or not to exist. Life is indeed an elusive reality that transcends
both the words and concepts of existence and nonexistence. It is neither exis-
tence nor nonexistence, yet exhibits the qualities of both. It is the mystic entity
of the Middle Way that is the ultimate reality. Myo is the name given to the
mystic nature of life, and ho, to its manifestations [the manifestations of the
mind of myo]. Renge, which means lotus flower, is used to symbolize the
wonder of this Law. If we understand that our life at this moment is myo, then
we will also understand that our life at other moments is the Mystic Law. This
realization is the mystic kyo, or sutra. The Lotus Sutra is the king of sutras, the
direct path to enlightenment, for it explains that the entity of our life, which
manifests either good or evil at each moment, is in fact the entity of the
Mystic Law. ("On Attaining Buddhahood in This Lifetime," The Writings of Nichiren Daishonin, vol. 1, p. 4)

Polishing Our Lives Through Daily Challenge
いいいいいいいいいいいいいいいいいいいいいいいいいいいいいいいいいいいいいいい
The Vimalakirti Sutra states that, when one seeks the Buddhas' emancipation
in the minds of ordinary beings, one finds that ordinary beings are the entities
of enlightenment, and that the sufferings of birth and death are nirvana. It
also states that, if the minds of living beings are impure, their land is also
impure, but if their minds are pure, so is their land. There are not two lands,
pure or impure in themselves. The difference lies solely in the good or evil of
our minds.
It is the same with a Buddha and an ordinary being. When deluded, one is
called an ordinary being, but when enlightened, one is called a Buddha. This
is similar to a tarnished mirror that will shine like a jewel when polished. A
mind now clouded by the illusions of the innate darkness of life is like a tar-
nished mirror, but when polished, it is sure to become like a clear mirror,
reflecting the essential nature of phenomena [i.e., the Dharma nature] and the
true aspect of reality. Arouse deep faith, and diligently polish your mirror day
and night. How should you polish it? Only by chanting Nam-myoho-renge-
