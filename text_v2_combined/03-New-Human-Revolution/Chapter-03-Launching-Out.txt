Volume 30: Chapter 3, Launching Out 11 through 20

Launching Out 11

During April 1996, Shin'ichi Yamamoto visited Guilin, China, where he met with Li Luogong, president of the Guilin Art Academy. Their discussion about calligraphy left a lasting impression on Shin'ichi, particularly Li's observation that calligraphy expresses "one's view of the world and the universe, as well as one's character."

Yamamoto then traveled to Shanghai, the final stop of the delegation's China visit. He visited a correctional school for troubled youth, emphasizing to students that "as long as you keep challenging yourself, there is hope." He urged them not to surrender to despair, stating that personal perseverance leads to broader victories.

Launching Out 12

In Shanghai, Yamamoto met with Fudan University President Su Buqing, a renowned mathematician and long-time acquaintance. During their conversation about education, Su shared his philosophy: learning requires advancing methodically through stages, never skipping steps. He emphasized that persistent effort through moments of apparent impossibility ultimately leads to breakthroughs.

The two men maintained their friendship through subsequent meetings and correspondence over many years.

Launching Out 13

Yamamoto also met with Ba Jin, a prominent Chinese writer and vice-chair of the China Writers Association. This was their second encounter, following an earlier meeting in Japan where they had discussed literature and society. Ba Jin had previously declared his commitment to writing against oppressive forces and outdated systems.

Launching Out 14

The conversation between Yamamoto and Ba Jin explored the relationship between literature and politics. Ba Jin asserted that "literature cannot be separated from politics. But politics can never replace literature." He discussed his experience during China's Cultural Revolution, when he was condemned, and his determination to write about those experiences.

Launching Out 15

Yamamoto and Ba Jin developed a lasting friendship. The China Writers Association later honored Yamamoto with an International Literary Award for Understanding and Friendship in 2003. Ba Jin passed away in 2005 at age 100, and fellow writer Bing Xin died in 1999 at age 98.

On April 29, Yamamoto departed Shanghai for Japan. Before leaving, he wrote a poem in the hotel guest book referencing Nichiren's teachings about Buddhism's eastward transmission and its eventual return westward.

Launching Out 16

Yamamoto's return to Japan marked the beginning of a new phase in his efforts. He landed in Nagasaki on April 29, determined to strengthen the Soka Gakkai membership and protect them from institutional pressures. Members greeted him warmly at the airport despite hardships they had endured.

Launching Out 17

Yamamoto visited the Nagasaki Culture Center, where a leaders meeting commemorated the 22nd anniversary of Nagasaki Chapter's establishment. He spoke about developing Buddhahood within oneself and dedicating efforts to kosen-rufu, the widespread propagation of Buddhist practice. He noted that while the Soka Gakkai had achieved significant membership milestones, the global movement remained "still in its infancy."

Launching Out 18

At a press conference, Yamamoto discussed his China visit and its significance for world peace. He emphasized the importance of Buddhist study and spreading humanistic philosophy during the approaching 21st century. The Seikyo Shimbun reported on his activities and announced his plans to visit members in various Japanese cities.

Launching Out 19

Before departing Nagasaki, Yamamoto visited the home of Kikumaru Obayashi, fulfilling a promise made 23 years earlier. The family had prepared for his visit through dedicated practice. During their conversation, they discussed his resignation from his previous position and expressed their indignation at institutional injustices.

Launching Out 20

At Nagasaki Station, Yamamoto addressed gathered members, encouraging them to advance with confidence. As his train traveled toward Fukuoka, Soka Gakkai members gathered at successive stations to greet him. Yamamoto reflected deeply on their dedication and sacrifice, recognizing them as the foundation of the movement's growth. He emphasized that organizational leaders exist to serve members' happiness and spiritual development.

Volume 30: Chapter 3, Launching Out 21 through 30

Launching Out 21

Shin'ichi Yamamoto arrives at the Kyushu Culture Center in Fukuoka on April 30, where members eagerly greet him. A woman shares her success opening a restaurant featured in a magazine, inviting him to visit.

The following day, May 1, large crowds of members gather. When a young men's division leader tries to manage the flow of visitors, Shin'ichi firmly states: "No one has the right to stop those who have come here to meet me from doing so."

He spends the day meeting members and visiting the woman's restaurant, determined to encourage as many people as possible during this important counteroffensive period.

Launching Out 22

On May 1 afternoon, Shin'ichi visits the Soka Gakkai Kyushu Memorial Hall, then addresses Fukuoka Prefecture headquarters leaders. He calls out powerfully: "Never lower the banner of kosen-rufu in your hearts!"

Representatives from Oita Prefecture attend, a region suffering from priesthood conflicts. Members tearfully request Shin'ichi visit their prefecture.

By May 2 when Shin'ichi departs, he has encouraged more than 20,000 members across various Kyushu venues.

Launching Out 23

Takeo Yamaoka, Oita's prefecture secretary, reports to Shin'ichi about a Nichiren Shoshu chief priest attempting to persuade Soka Gakkai members to quit. Yamaoka had spent the night confronting the priest before traveling to Fukuoka.

Shin'ichi responds warmly, sharing his own experiences with priesthood discussions. He expresses determination: "We must protect the precious children of the Buddha" and asks Yamaoka to safeguard the members as his representative.

After encouraging the members, Shin'ichi flies to Kansai on May 3, 1980—the first official Soka Gakkai Day.

Launching Out 24

At the newly opened Kansai Culture Center in Osaka, crowds of members arrive throughout May 3. Despite space limitations, Shin'ichi directs staff to open the gates, saying members outside are "the most important of all."

He takes numerous photographs with members and event staff, instructing staff to record names for later copies.

Launching Out 25

Shin'ichi climbs emergency stairs to reach the Ever-Victorious Hall in the annex building where hundreds of members have gathered. Upon entering, he greets them warmly and speaks about bonds forged through faith.

He emphasizes: "While struggling each day with all sorts of personal problems and hardships, you are devoting yourselves with a bright, positive spirit to sharing Buddhism with others."

After addressing the hall, he returns outside to photograph additional members who have gathered.

Launching Out 26

At the main commemorative gongyo meeting, Shin'ichi addresses the significance of May 3 as Soka Gakkai Day. He discusses the Mystic Law's eternity and the importance of overcoming the "eight winds"—obstacles that cause people to lose faith.

He calls Kansai to become "a model for Japan and the world" and pledges to continue writing history with members' support. The assembly concludes with members singing the Kansai song.

Launching Out 27

Following the main meeting, Shin'ichi encourages members in other rooms and attends a 5:00 p.m. gongyo meeting. He plays piano for participants and takes countless photographs despite his hand becoming red and swollen.

At the Kansai Makiguchi Memorial Hall that evening, Shin'ichi creates calligraphy reading "May 3" with significant dates: 1951 representing Toda's inauguration, 1960 representing his own, and future milestones in 1983 and 2001.

Launching Out 28

On May 4, Shin'ichi attends a gongyo meeting for Tottori Prefecture members at the Kansai Toda Memorial Auditorium. The chapter was established on his inauguration date in 1960, making this their 20th anniversary.

He addresses members as "noble Bodhisattvas of the Earth" and emphasizes: "All adversity is just a step toward achieving a state of boundless happiness."

Launching Out 29

Shin'ichi attends four Osaka Prefecture chapter leaders meetings celebrating the Kansai Culture Center's opening. Between sessions, he photographs university group members and shakes hands with numerous leaders.

His guidance emphasizes health, vitality, and recognizing that adversity enables karmic transformation. He stresses: "steadfast faith—an unflagging, lifelong commitment to remain part of the movement for kosen-rufu—is the key to great victory in life."

Launching Out 30

On May 5, Soka Gakkai Successors Day, Shin'ichi meets with representatives from youth divisions at the Kansai Culture Center. He addresses young members about personal development, parental appreciation, and building solid foundations through patience.

He encourages Future Division members to persevere in studies and faith, guiding them toward becoming capable contributors to kosen-rufu.

Volume 30: Chapter 3, Launching Out 31 through 40

Launching Out 31

Shin'ichi addressed young men's division leaders in Osaka on May 5, encouraging them to maintain steadfast faith through life's challenges. He emphasized that consistent chanting of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo brings good fortune and personal growth. Later, he spoke to young women's division leaders, urging them to view faith as never abandoning the Gohonzon, regardless of circumstances.

Launching Out 32

Shin'ichi met with members of Tetsujin-kai, a stage crew group. They had crafted a chair for his use, and he expressed deep appreciation for their sincere gesture and behind-the-scenes support. He later addressed the Kansai Comrades-in-Faith Group, describing truly capable individuals as those awakened to their mission as Bodhisattvas of the Earth.

Launching Out 33

On May 6, Shin'ichi conducted three gongyo meetings at the Kansai Culture Center. To women's division members, he taught that "happiness is found in your immediate environment" and that problems nourish happiness. He instructed the men's division that their chanting reverberates throughout the universe. Additional gongyo sessions were added due to overwhelming member attendance.

Launching Out 34

After seven days in Kansai, Shin'ichi had encouraged over 70,000 members. He reflected on a 1969 visit when he had nursed a high fever but continued guiding members in Wakayama, expending all his strength. He departed for Nagoya on May 8, carrying forward the selfless spirit needed to fulfill kosen-rufu's great vow.

Launching Out 35

In Nagoya, long lines formed at the Chubu Culture Center. Shin'ichi held five gongyo sessions that morning despite a sore throat, meeting with hundreds of members. He continued through afternoon and evening sessions, meeting people even after 10:00 p.m. In Gifu Prefecture, he met a nearly 100-year-old pioneer member and presented her with carnations on Mother's Day.

Launching Out 36

At the Kakamigahara Culture Center, Shin'ichi climbed the spiral fire escape to enter the overcrowded building. He told members "everything's all right now! You've won" and played piano for them. During his Chubu visit, he participated in over 100 group photo sessions and proposed that nineteen members at a train station be known as the Hashima Group.

Launching Out 37

Shin'ichi returned to Tokyo on May 14 after visiting Nagasaki, Fukuoka, Osaka, Aichi, Gifu, and Shizuoka prefectures, encouraging over 150,000 members. He focused on rebuilding the Tokyo organization while contending with organizational crises. Tomomasa Yamawaki, facing massive business debts, had become involved in extortion schemes and was manipulating young priests antagonistic to the Soka Gakkai.

Launching Out 38

Yamawaki had collaborated with Takao Harayama, the Study Department leader, who photocopied documents from the Seikyo Shimbun Building in September 1979. Yamawaki used these materials to drive wedges between the priesthood and Gakkai. In April 1980, he began extorting money, eventually demanding 300 million yen, then 500 million yen.

Launching Out 39

On June 7, the Gakkai filed an extortion complaint against Yamawaki. That same day, anti-Gakkai priest candidates won ten of sixteen Council seats. The following month, young priests formed the Shoshin-kai organization and attacked the Gakkai during temple lectures despite administrative directives to cease. Members endured media attacks while continuing their faith practice.

Launching Out 40

Toward July's end, Shin'ichi met with Seikyo Shimbun editors regarding his new essay series "Unforgettable Friends in Faith" and the resumption of his serialized novel, The Human Revolution. Despite concerns about priest opposition, he resolved to resume writing to inspire members facing persecution. He declared his responsibility was "to protect the children of the Buddha, our members."

Volume 30: Chapter 3, Launching Out 41 through 50

Summary

This section from The New Human Revolution covers events from 1980 through 1981, chronicling Shin'ichi Yamamoto's leadership of the Soka Gakkai during a turbulent period with Nichiren Shoshu.

Key Themes

Dedication to Publication and Members

Yamamoto worked intensely to serialize The Human Revolution despite illness, believing the publication would inspire members. He dictated manuscripts in short bursts between rest periods, driven by commitment to his audience.

International Expansion

Yamamoto embarked on extensive world travels to celebrate two decades of kosen-rufu in America. His visits to Hawaii, San Francisco, Washington D.C., Chicago, and Los Angeles encompassed meetings with thousands of members and government officials. The trip demonstrated the movement's global reach across approximately 90 countries.

Personal Transformation Stories

The narrative highlights Sachie Perry, a Hiroshima bombing survivor who overcame domestic violence, poverty, and racial discrimination through Buddhist practice. Her family's musical performance at a Chicago culture festival exemplified how faith transforms individual lives into sources of broader social change.

Institutional Challenge

Internal conflict within Nichiren Shoshu intensified, with dissident priests known as Shoshin-kai attacking the Soka Gakkai despite priesthood directives for harmony. Yamamoto maintained his commitment to supporting both the lay organization and the priesthood despite mounting tension.

Renewed Commitment

The 50th anniversary celebration and New Year 1981 marked fresh determination to advance worldwide kosen-rufu during what the organization designated the "Year of Youth."

Volume 30: Chapter 3, Launching Out 51 through 60

Launching Out 51

Shin'ichi emphasized the importance of practicing Buddhism through both action and study. He stated that genuine disciples of Nichiren must engage in both, noting that "practice and study arise from faith." He warned against becoming overly focused on Buddhist doctrine while neglecting actual practice, explaining that such imbalance leads practitioners astray. The Soka Gakkai's approach to study remains oriented toward deepening faith and achieving happiness rather than producing professional scholars.

Launching Out 52

During his Hawaii visit, Shin'ichi paid respects at the USS Arizona Memorial and participated in cultural festivals. He spoke about spreading Nichiren Buddhism to build world peace, emphasizing that "respect for the dignity of life starts with manifesting our inherent Buddhahood." He later traveled to Los Angeles, where a culture festival drew approximately 15,000 attendees celebrating the city's bicentennial with performances by Japanese and American members.

Launching Out 53

Tomomasa Yamawaki was arrested on charges of extortion and attempted extortion following a police investigation. Yamawaki had waged smear campaigns against the Soka Gakkai through tabloid publications, but these allegations proved baseless during his trial. Shin'ichi interrupted his U.S. activities to return to Japan, where he underwent interviews with the prosecutor's office before resuming his international travels.

Launching Out 54

Shin'ichi traveled to Mexico for his second formal visit in 16 years. He visited cultural sites, met with government officials including the Mexican president, and donated books to universities. While touring Mexico City, he visited the Angel of Independence Monument, recalling his mentor Josei Toda's vivid dream-like description of the same location. Toda had encouraged him: "You must go out into the world. The world is your true stage."

Launching Out 55

Shin'ichi reflected on Toda's influence as he stood before the Independence Monument. Though Toda never left Japan, he had studied Mexican geography extensively and encouraged his disciple to travel globally for kosen-rufu. Shin'ichi renewed his commitment to building worldwide Buddhist movements in Toda's honor. He subsequently visited Guadalajara, delivering a lecture on Mexican culture and its importance for peace-building.

Launching Out 56

Shin'ichi's lecture at the University of Guadalajara highlighted "the unique warmth of the people of Mexico" and their poetic spirit. He praised Mexico's efforts to maintain Latin America as a nuclear-free zone. After returning briefly to Los Angeles and Hawaii, he arrived back in Japan on March 12 to attend Soka Gakkai Day celebrations, then departed again on May 9 for the Soviet Union, Europe, and North America.

Launching Out 57

Shin'ichi visited the Soviet Union at the invitation of Moscow State University and the Ministry of Higher Education, bringing a delegation of approximately 250 members including musical and performance groups. He met with numerous Soviet officials and cultural leaders, visiting the Moscow Musical Theater for Children and paying respects at significant Soviet monuments. He also visited the gravesite of former Premier Aleksey Kosygin, whom he had previously met to discuss peace initiatives.

Launching Out 58

Director Lyudmila Gvishiani, daughter of the late Premier Kosygin, met with Shin'ichi at the All-Union State Library of Foreign Literature. She presented him with a crystal vase honoring her father and his final writings, explaining that "these books still retain the warmth of my father's hands." This exchange exemplified how personal friendships could bridge political differences and promote lasting peace.

Launching Out 59

Shin'ichi visited the grave of former Moscow State University Rector Rem Khokhlov and met with his family, including his widow Elena and sons Aleksei and Dmitry. The conversation touched on scholarly pursuits and personal growth. Shin'ichi encouraged the sons to "become great scholars who surpass even your father and make a positive contribution to society." These deep-rooted friendships demonstrated how personal connections foster peaceful exchange.

Launching Out 60

Shin'ichi engaged in extensive dialogue with Moscow State University Rector Anatoli Logunov about educational exchange, world peace, and nuclear disarmament. Logunov stated that "nuclear weapons would result in the complete annihilation of the human race," emphasizing that peace must be pursued through wisdom rather than force. Their conversations, totaling 13 meetings over time, produced two published dialogues exploring humanity and peace, demonstrating that "world peace begins with joining people's hearts."

Volume 30: Chapter 3, Launching Out 61 through 65

Launching Out 61

A Japan-Soviet Student Friendship Festival occurred at Moscow State University on May 13. The Soka University Ginrei Chorus and delegation members performed Japanese and Russian songs, with both university choruses joining together for musical performances at the event's conclusion.

Shin'ichi recalled delivering a lecture at this venue six years prior titled "A New Road of East-West Cultural Exchange," where he envisioned cultural exchange as a spiritual pathway connecting world populations.

On May 14, Shin'ichi met with Soviet Premier Nikolai Tikhonov at the Kremlin, presenting flowers for the premier's 76th birthday. Describing himself as "an ordinary citizen who loves peace," Shin'ichi emphasized that genuine dialogue rooted in sincere humanity—not rhetoric—awakens people's fundamental desire for peace.

Launching Out 62

During their conversation, Shin'ichi encouraged the premier to pursue a multinational summit involving Soviet, American, Chinese, and Japanese leaders in a neutral location like Switzerland to prevent war and provide global reassurance. He stressed the importance of cultural exchange preceding diplomatic treaties between Japan and the Soviet Union.

Premier Tikhonov acknowledged that cultural exchange had lagged and agreed to pursue greater bilateral exchange. Shin'ichi also delivered a letter addressed to General Secretary Brezhnev expressing gratitude for the invitation.

Shin'ichi's 1983 and 1985 peace proposals urged U.S.-Soviet leadership dialogue. When Mikhail Gorbachev became general secretary in 1985, he initiated Cold War reconciliation, meeting with President Ronald Reagan in Geneva that November. By December 1989, Gorbachev and President George H.W. Bush declared the Cold War's end in Malta.

In 1990, Shin'ichi met with Gorbachev and they published the dialogue Moral Lessons of the Twentieth Century.

Launching Out 63

On May 14 evening, Shin'ichi hosted a banquet thanking those who assisted his visit. The following day, he visited Tolstoy House and the State Literary Museum of Leo Tolstoy in Moscow.

The modest 19th-century wooden residence preserved Tolstoy's study with his original desk, chair, and writing implements. He composed Resurrection and other significant works there during his final 19 years. The museum displayed his elementary compositions, lifelong diary, manuscripts of major novels, and a large green glass paperweight gifted by factory workers bearing inscriptions honoring his dedication to justice.

Tolstoy fought poverty and hypocrisy through his writing, resulting in harsh censorship and his excommunication by the Russian Church. The people, recognizing his sincerity and commitment to human welfare, defended him steadfastly.

Launching Out 64

Tolstoy pursued understanding genuine religion, perceiving God as humanity's highest spiritual pinnacle—the crystallization of conscience—rather than as traditionally taught. He advocated moral regeneration, rejecting violence and promoting nonviolent resistance, positions incompatible with the Russian Orthodox Church's state alignment.

His novels Resurrection and writings like "What I Believe" circulated underground or internationally due to publication prohibitions. Victor Hugo's observation that "Derision is counted by posterity as the sound of honor" resonated with Tolstoy's experience as worldwide support grew, including from Mahatma Gandhi.

The Church's excommunication backfired, generating international support making government suppression difficult. Instead, authorities persecuted Tolstoy's disciples, exiling Vladimir Chertkov and sentencing Paul Biriukov to internal exile, though he later completed Leo Tolstoy: His Life and Work.

Ordinary citizens faced persecution merely for possessing banned books, yet remained steadfast. True religion's value derives from what it brings people—courage, hope, wisdom, and liberation from suffering.

Launching Out 65

Visiting these locations, Shin'ichi found renewed courage from Tolstoy's legacy, reflecting on the proverb: "Do what you must, come what may." He felt strengthened in his mission pursuing world peace through worldwide kosen-rufu.

The group visited the Space Pavilion of the Exhibition of Achievements of National Economy, appreciating Soviet technological accomplishment. Shin'ichi expressed hope these achievements would serve humanity's peace and prosperity.

May 16 concluded Shin'ichi's eight-day Soviet visit. Before departing for Frankfurt and his European tour, Minister Vyacheslav Yelyutin invited him sailing along the Moscow-Volga canal, discussing educational exchange.

Observing the beautiful banks and waterway network connecting five seas, Shin'ichi reflected that educational exchange resembles canal building—intentionally linking diverse nations, ideologies, and peoples, creating friendship ports leading toward peace's great ocean.

At 7:00 p.m., Shin'ichi departed Sheremetyevo International Airport under bright evening daylight, excited for his European members' anticipated greeting.

This concludes "Launching Out," chapter 3 of volume 30 of The New Human Revolution.
