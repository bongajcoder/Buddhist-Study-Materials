Chapter 2: Awaiting the Time

Volume 30: Chapter 2, Awaiting the Time 11 through 20

Awaiting the Time 11

Shin'ichi met with Torao and Tami Tamori, the first chapter and women's division leaders of Karuizawa Chapter. Torao was a skilled baker whose bakery faced declining customers due to community prejudice against the Soka Gakkai. A senior member encouraged them by citing Nichiren Daishonin's teaching that obstacles arise when propagating correct doctrine.

Members responded to such challenges by deepening their faith and studying the Daishonin's writings. Torao reflected that hardship strengthens practitioners' resolve. This integration of Buddhist practice with daily life became the source of the Soka Gakkai's resilience, made possible by second president Josei Toda's publication of the Nichiren Daishonin's collected works.

Awaiting the Time 12

Torao persevered in his practice and eventually secured contracts supplying bread to schools and Western bakeries. His business flourished, demonstrating the benefits of Buddhist practice while contributing to community development. This success dispelled misconceptions about the Soka Gakkai.

Shin'ichi invited local members to gather at the Tamoris' coffee shop, where he shared Toda's vision of establishing a training center in Karuizawa. He emphasized that the Nagano Training Center would become a global resource for kosen-rufu, the widespread propagation of Buddhist teachings. That evening, at a joint leaders meeting, Shin'ichi played piano pieces to encourage the members, reinforcing their mentor-disciple bonds.

Awaiting the Time 13

Shin'ichi's aim was simply for members to maintain strong faith and achieve happiness. Behind the scenes, certain leaders and Nichiren Shoshu priests were attempting to break mentor-disciple bonds by restricting his public appearances and preventing coverage in the Seikyo Shimbun.

Rather than surrendering, Shin'ichi adapted his guidance through home visits, poetry, and music. He proposed that members gather on August 26 for group photographs at the training center. Youth division members enthusiastically prepared, organizing parking, coordinating arrival times, and even clearing a vacant lot for additional space.

Awaiting the Time 14

On August 24, the 32nd anniversary of joining the Soka Gakkai, Shin'ichi spent the day at the training center in earnest prayer and practice. He rode a bicycle through the area recalling Toda's memories from his final summer there.

When young educators arrived by bus, Shin'ichi greeted them warmly and took a group photograph. He encouraged them to remain steadfast, declaring: "Whatever might happen, never give up your faith." On August 25, he played tennis with Education Department members and participated in their training sessions, demonstrating his commitment despite restrictions on his activities.

Awaiting the Time 15

On August 25, heavy rain fell as young men's division members worked in the mud to clear the parking lot. Shin'ichi, concerned for their health, arranged for them to use the training center's bath afterward. He then visited Katsuo Ishizuka's home in Saku City to thank the family for providing a private meeting space for Soka Gakkai activities.

Learning it was Ishizuka's father's 80th birthday, Shin'ichi presented a handwritten poem expressing joy at the elder's longevity and wisdom.

Awaiting the Time 16

Shin'ichi advised Ishizuka on maintaining good neighbor relations regarding the private meeting space—addressing practical concerns like parking and noise while keeping communication open. He emphasized that such member-provided facilities serve as "castles of the people" dedicated to kosen-rufu.

After examining the upstairs community center in Ishizuka's building, Shin'ichi composed poems for the Saku members. He then visited the 350-year-old Kurabayashi family home, fulfilling a six-year-old promise to see their ancestral house.

Awaiting the Time 17

The Kurabayashi family, whose ancestors had served as district officials since the early Edo period, warmly welcomed Shin'ichi. Tatsuomi Kurabayashi was 71 with five children, all active Soka Gakkai members.

Kurabayashi shared a family legend about an ancestor who rescued a fox from an icy pond; the fox later left pheasants as tokens of gratitude. Shin'ichi connected this to the importance of repaying kindness, contrasting it with the ingratitude he was currently experiencing from certain individuals and priests attacking the Soka Gakkai.

Awaiting the Time 18

Ten grandchildren of Tatsuomi and Yoshino Kurabayashi performed music for Shin'ichi on various traditional and modern instruments. Seeing these young people inherit their family's faith gave Shin'ichi joy, as kosen-rufu develops through generations in local communities.

Walking in the garden as rain cleared, Shin'ichi told Kurabayashi: "Your life has been a great victory" with successful children and grandchildren. Yet he encouraged continued striving, saying "the most important time is from now on." He presented a poem celebrating the Kurabayashi home as a "silver castle."

Awaiting the Time 19

On August 26, members streamed to the training center from across Nagano Prefecture for group photographs. It had been nearly four months since Shin'ichi's activities appeared regularly in the Seikyo Shimbun, and members were eager to see him and renew their commitment.

When an elderly woman approached in tears, grateful to see him well, Shin'ichi warmly reassured her: "I will keep the memory of you forever in my heart and chant daimoku for you every day." To an 80-year-old woman, he urged: "Please live to be 100...and see the future of kosen-rufu!"

Awaiting the Time 20

Endless lines of members waited for group photographs across three bleacher stands. Members arrived from towns throughout the prefecture. As sessions concluded, a young men's division member passionately thanked Shin'ichi and pledged determination.

Shin'ichi responded with an impassioned address: "When the mentor cannot take action out in front, it's the job of the disciples to stand up." He declared members should declare, "Leave it to us!" and brighten others' hearts on his behalf. He asserted "each of you is Shin'ichi Yamamoto" and criticized weakness at crucial moments. Young people's eyes "sparkled with burning determination" as they resolved to shoulder responsibility for kosen-rufu in their communities.

Awaiting the Time 21

Shin'ichi encouraged landscape gardener Wataru Yanagisaka and his wife Shizu from Saku City, who maintained the Nagano Training Center grounds. He praised their dedication, noting that "all of your efforts are certain to bring you immeasurable benefits and boundless good fortune."

After completing 30 group photo sessions with over 3,000 members, Shin'ichi thanked the young volunteer staff and commended the prefecture's young men's division leader for organizing logistics despite difficult conditions. He emphasized the importance of remaining with the Soka Gakkai throughout life and dedicating oneself to members and kosen-rufu, encouraging them that "the Buddhas and heavenly deities are aware of all your efforts."

Awaiting the Time 22

On August 27, Shin'ichi visited the Komoro Culture Center, participating in group photo sessions with approximately 300 members. He stressed the importance of prioritizing daimoku, the practice of chanting, and practicing with courageous faith.

During his final day in Nagano on August 28, he spoke with Nagano Prefecture Leader Takashi Saida about the training center's potential. He urged the prefecture to become "the world's foremost model of human harmony" and emphasized that unity requires prefecture leaders to demonstrate genuine concern for members' welfare. He stressed that people respond to earnest, sincere leadership rather than lazy or irresponsible guidance.

Awaiting the Time 23

Shin'ichi returned to Tokyo on August 28 after nine days of intensive member encouragement in Nagano. Though his efforts received minimal coverage in the Seikyo Shimbun, his subsequent annual visits sparked expanding training courses that became a new Soka Gakkai tradition.

The training center eventually hosted regional, divisional, and national executive conferences, attracting international scholars and thinkers including writer Chinghiz Aitmatov, philosophers from Delaware University, John Dewey Society leaders, and officials from institutions in India and China.

On August 6, 1993, Shin'ichi began writing his serialized novel The New Human Revolution at the Nagano Training Center. Members regarded their shared struggles with Shin'ichi as their greatest pride, developing an "invincible fighting spirit" grounded in mentor-disciple unity.

Awaiting the Time 24

On September 15, known as Respect for the Aged Day, Shin'ichi completed his 30th home visit since May, visiting pioneer members in Komae City. He had prayed earnestly during the 1974 Typhoon Polly disaster that swept away homes in the area.

Observing the developing suburban landscape, he told accompanying members that "Tokyo Number 2 Area is a fresh stage for kosen-rufu. It has a bright future." He highlighted the importance of self-motivated, proactive faith and the joy found in setting personal goals and working self-reliantly to achieve them.

He quoted author Saneatsu Mushanokoji: "Another step forward...Now is the crucial moment." Such accumulated steps transform lives, communities, and society.

Awaiting the Time 25

As founder of Soka University, Soka Junior and Senior High Schools, and Tokyo Soka Elementary School, Shin'ichi prioritized education as his life's crowning endeavor. In September 1979, he participated in Asian pear-picking with university and high school students and took photos with correspondence course participants.

He drew from personal experience, having graduated from Toyo Commercial High School's night course and attended Taisei Gakuin's night college starting in 1948. After the publishing company where he worked collapsed in 1949, he discontinued formal studies but received intensive private instruction from his mentor Josei Toda—what he called "Toda University."

Years later, Shin'ichi completed 10 graduating papers, including one on Japanese industrial capital. This experience deepened his empathy for correspondence students facing study challenges while working, reinforcing his determination to support their perseverance.

Awaiting the Time 26

During September campus visits, Shin'ichi joined rugby, baseball, and table tennis teams for photographs. Speaking at the October athletic meet closing ceremony, he urged students to master fundamentals during university to address future societal challenges.

He attended elementary school events like athletic meets and potato-digging days, visited dormitory students, encouraging them to become "shining presences" who warmly supported others and imparted hope and courage.

At the November 2 Soka University Festival and November 3 Soyu-kai alumni meeting, he engaged with graduates pursuing self-development. One alumnus declared: "The time for simply declaring determinations is past...It is time for us to report our results...That is what it means to stand up as disciples."

Shin'ichi responded approvingly, urging them to "pave the way forward with the spirit that you are all the founders."

Awaiting the Time 27

On November 16, a Soka Gakkai Headquarters leaders meeting commemorating the organization's 49th founding anniversary was held at the Toda Memorial Auditorium in Sugamo, Toshima Ward—location of the Tokyo Detention Center where founders Makiguchi and Toda were imprisoned, with Makiguchi dying for his beliefs.

The auditorium, completed in June 1979, stood as a lasting monument to their dedication. Shin'ichi determined to create "a victorious groundswell for kosen-rufu" from this historically significant location.

He reflected on Nichiren Daishonin's teaching: "When great evil occurs, great good follows." Makiguchi's sacrifice opened the way for kosen-rufu's triumphant development, though transformation requires "firmly determined" commitment and "courageous action."

Awaiting the Time 28

Halfway through the November 16 meeting, Shin'ichi entered the stage to enthusiastic applause. Instead of speaking, he removed his jacket and led members in the "Song of Indomitable Dignity"—his first time leading members in song since stepping down as president.

He demonstrated that "no matter what limits are put on our actions, if we maintain an unshakable commitment to kosen-rufu, nothing will block our way forward."

As he led the rousing melody, audience members clapped vigorously, sang with emotion, and blazed with fighting spirit. Their unified participation created new momentum for victory from Tokyo that day, embodying the principle that "Buddhism is about winning" and that champions of kosen-rufu are champions of life and happiness.

Awaiting the Time 29

Shin'ichi continued meeting divisional and regional representatives at the Kanagawa Training Center and Shinjuku Culture Center despite tabloid attacks on the Soka Gakkai. He found inspiration in witnessing encouraged members overcome obstacles and achieve victory.

While conversing with young men's division and student division leaders at Yokohama's Kanagawa Culture Center, one young leader expressed sadness that Shin'ichi no longer gave guidance at meetings. Shin'ichi responded sharply: "If that's how the youth feel, then you must all take action...Youth must resolve to take full responsibility and be the driving force for development."

When the leader mentioned senior opposition to youth proposals, Shin'ichi acknowledged that generational tension occurs in all organizations. Older people bring valuable experience but may resist unfamiliar ideas; when circumstances change dramatically, experience-based approaches become inadequate.

Awaiting the Time 30

Shin'ichi advised youth division leaders to develop persuasion skills by explaining proposals clearly, logically, citing data and examples. He referenced Nichiren Daishonin: "Buddhism is reason. Reason will win over your lord."

He emphasized the importance of passionate youth appeals, establishing successful track records, and persistence despite rejection. He illustrated from his 1954 appointment as youth division chief of staff: the board initially doubted his proposals, including the athletic meet concept that later became a Soka Gakkai hallmark.

"But after several such events were held and widely applauded, they went on to become a hallmark of the Soka Gakkai. It was a victory of the power of youth."

Volume 30: Chapter 2, Awaiting the Time 31 through 40

Key Themes

This section explores principles of unity and organizational leadership within the Soka Gakkai movement, centered on teachings about "many in body, one in mind."

Unity and Diversity, Sections 31 through 33

Shin'ichi discusses how organizations must balance different opinions while maintaining cohesion. He explains that as long as decisions follow democratic processes, members should support outcomes even when their preferences weren't chosen. The core principle involves respecting individual differences while uniting toward shared goals.

The Nichiren Daishonin's teaching states: "All disciples and lay supporters...should chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo with the spirit of many in body but one in mind." This metaphor compares organizational strength to castle walls built from stones of varied shapes that interlock for stability.

Internal Threats, Section 34

Shin'ichi warns that self-centeredness undermines movements more than external opposition. Those who prioritize personal advancement over collective mission ultimately lose trust and separate from the organization. He references the Daishonin's concept of "worms born of the lion's body"—internal threats from disciples themselves.

Leadership Through Mentorship, Section 35

Shin'ichi reflects on his mentor Josei Toda's strict guidance, comparing it to testing lion cubs. He emphasizes that firm mentorship demonstrates compassion and commitment to developing genuine successors.

Arakawa Campaign, Sections 36 through 40

The final sections describe December 1979 activities, including encouragement for members in Tokyo's Arakawa Ward and attendance at a Fife and Drum Corps performance celebrating youth and cultural activities oriented toward building an age centered on people's happiness.

Shin'ichi addressed performers, emphasizing that "any beautiful accomplishment is backed by arduous effort." He encouraged young members to view coming challenges as opportunities for growth toward the 21st century.

New Year 1980, Awaiting the Time 43 and 44

Shin'ichi published poems in the Seikyo Shimbun expressing determination to advance kosen-rufu. Members wrote encouraging letters despite ongoing persecution from Nichiren Shoshu priests. The new decade began amid global turmoil—Iran's Islamic revolution, Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and Middle East tensions.

The Shikoku Ferry Visit, Awaiting the Time 45 through 50

Members from Shikoku creatively circumvented restrictions by chartering a ferry to visit Shin'ichi at the Kanagawa Culture Center on January 14, 1980. Rather than waiting for him to travel, approximately 800 members made the journey by sea, demonstrating what Shin'ichi called "wisdom and resourcefulness" in overcoming obstacles.

The visit included tours of the Toda Peace Memorial Hall, reinforcing the organization's commitment to peace activism and human rights.

Volume 30: Chapter 2, Awaiting the Time 51 through 60

Awaiting the Time 51

A joint leaders meeting between Kanagawa and Shikoku members takes place at the Kanagawa Culture Center. Nearly nine months have passed since Shin'ichi resigned as Soka Gakkai president. The Shikoku members traveled despite turbulent conditions to meet their mentor, demonstrating their seeking spirit and unity in faith.

Awaiting the Time 52

Shin'ichi addresses Shikoku men's leaders about respectful guidance. He explains that mentor Josei Toda's scolding served three purposes: training disciples for greater responsibility, helping members overcome obstacles to faith, and protecting the organization's unity. He emphasizes that leaders must always show compassion when correcting members.

Awaiting the Time 53

Shin'ichi engages members in conversation about their lives and leadership challenges. He stresses that leaders must respect members' wishes while patiently encouraging even those resistant to practice. The group performs gongyo together, followed by dinner discussions and performances by various divisions.

Awaiting the Time 54

Shin'ichi plays several piano pieces for the gathered members, including songs evoking mentor-disciple bonds and the courage needed to advance kosen-rufu during adversity. The evening concludes with the Shikoku members departing by ship, with over 200 Kanagawa members gathering on the pier to see them off with songs and cheers.

Awaiting the Time 55

As the ship departs, Shin'ichi and his wife wave flashlights from the culture center's top floor to bid farewell. The Shikoku members respond emotionally from the deck. Shin'ichi chants for their safe voyage and later phones to confirm their well-being, viewing his disciples as his greatest treasure.

Awaiting the Time 56

About a month later, eighty-six young women's division members from Amami Oshima in Kyushu travel to Tokyo's Tachikawa Culture Center. A year earlier, Shin'ichi had encouraged their leader to organize this visit. Despite Shin'ichi's resignation as president, the young women achieved significant victories spreading Buddhism in their challenging island communities.

Awaiting the Time 57

The narrative recounts the history of Amami Oshima members, who faced severe persecution including confiscated religious objects and social exclusion. Rei Osada, the young women's division leader, grew up witnessing her mother's steadfast practice despite poverty and opposition. These experiences shaped her unwavering commitment to kosen-rufu.

Awaiting the Time 58

When a Nichiren Shoshu priest's wife attempts to pressure Rei to abandon the Soka Gakkai, Rei responds with conviction about the organization's role in her family's spiritual development. The young women's fighting spirit carries forward this legacy of perseverance.

Awaiting the Time 59

The young women depart Amami Oshima on February 15, traveling by ferry and airplane to Tokyo. Upon arrival, they visit the Soka Young Women's Center on a cold evening. Shin'ichi had arranged warm red bean soup for members unaccustomed to Tokyo's winter temperatures, demonstrating his attentive care.

Awaiting the Time 60

Shin'ichi welcomes the Amami young women warmly, encouraging them to honor the pioneering efforts of earlier members. He gives special attention to a member with cerebral palsy in a wheelchair, assuring her: "Everything's going to be all right now." She had worked to improve her mobility specifically to make this journey and meet her mentor, ultimately achieving personal triumph through faith.

Volume 30: Chapter 2, Awaiting the Time 61 through 68

Summary

This chapter from The New Human Revolution depicts Shin'ichi Yamamoto's activities approximately one year after stepping down as Soka Gakkai president in April 1979. The narrative covers his encouragement of members facing organizational challenges.

Key Events

Amami Young Women's Division Visit, Sections 61 and 62

Shin'ichi meets with young women traveling from remote Amami Islands to Tokyo. He emphasizes that becoming happy represents the proof of Nichiren Buddhism's validity. The women perform folk songs at a health seminar, and Shin'ichi encourages them by stating that small island communities can become models for global kosen-rufu development.

Meguro Peace Center Visits, Sections 63 through 65

Shin'ichi visits members in Tokyo's Meguro Ward who endure criticism from anti-Soka Gakkai priests. He meets the "Brave Generals Group," a men's division training organization, and plays piano pieces to uplift members' spirits during this difficult period.

Organizational Crisis, Sections 66 through 68

The chapter documents the intensifying conflict with Nichiren Shoshu priests and attorney Tomomasa Yamawaki's role in inciting opposition. Despite restrictions preventing him from speaking at headquarters meetings, grassroots members demonstrate unwavering commitment through letters and personal visits. Shin'ichi publishes an article on Josei Toda's memorial, signaling preparation for renewed leadership action.
