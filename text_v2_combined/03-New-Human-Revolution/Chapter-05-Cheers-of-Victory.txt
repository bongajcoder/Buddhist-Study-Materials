Cheers of Victory 1

The passage opens with reflection on youth as protagonists of the future, emphasizing their role in shaping society through their aspirations and actions. Shin'ichi Yamamoto, returning from international travels, resolved to focus on developing young people within the Soka Gakkai.

On July 10, 1981, a youth division general meeting commemorated the 30th anniversary of the young men's and women's divisions in Osaka. Yamamoto sent a congratulatory poem expressing hopes for youth leadership, incorporating a Confucian reference to maturity at age thirty.

Cheers of Victory 2

Yamamoto's message called for global youth unity in advancing peace and kosen-rufu. Simultaneously, approximately one thousand South American members gathered in Foz do Iguacu, Brazil, for the first regional young men's division general meeting, with participants traveling from across the continent.

Cheers of Victory 3

President Kiyoshi Jujo died suddenly of a heart attack on July 18, 1981, at age 58. He had served as president since 1979 during turbulent conflicts with the priesthood. Jujo and Yamamoto had worked together for decades, sharing struggles for kosen-rufu and maintaining the mentor-disciple relationship Yamamoto considered essential for organizational continuity.

Cheers of Victory 4

Yamamoto visited Jujo's home to offer condolences, encouraging his widow to continue his legacy. That afternoon, Vice President Eisuke Akizuki was unanimously appointed as the fifth Soka Gakkai president. Yamamoto believed Akizuki's calm leadership would guide the organization forward while maintaining harmony with changing times.

Cheers of Victory 5

Formal memorial services occurred July 23 and 24 at the Tokyo Toda Memorial Auditorium. Yamamoto maintained his demanding schedule, meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger on July 25 and attending various leadership meetings and regional events through August.

Cheers of Victory 6

Yamamoto would meet with United Nations Under-Secretary-General Yasushi Akashi eighteen times. These collaborations produced exhibitions on nuclear threats, war and peace, and human rights. In 1992, when Akashi directed UN operations in Cambodia, Soka Gakkai youth collected over 280,000 radios for the nation's post-civil war elections.

The Second SGI General Meeting in Honolulu drew 7,500 international representatives. Commemorative services marked the 700th anniversary of Nichiren Daishonin's passing in October.

Cheers of Victory 7

Internal priesthood conflicts intensified as the Shoshin-kai group faced expulsion from Nichiren Shoshu. Over 180 priests were eventually removed. Despite harassment, Soka Gakkai members remained committed to kosen-rufu, viewing persecution as validation of their mission.

Cheers of Victory 8

On October 31, Yamamoto delivered a university lecture titled "Thoughts on History and Historical Figures: Living amid Persecution," discussing eminent figures including Sugawara Michizane, Rai San'yo, Mahatma Gandhi, and Victor Hugo who persevered through adversity. He characterized "persecution is a badge of honor for a Buddhist."

Cheers of Victory 9

After November 8 activities in the Kansai region, Yamamoto traveled to Tokushima in Shikoku to celebrate completion of the Tokushima Auditorium. Despite uncertainty about his attendance, members prepared eagerly, having endured priest-related hardships while maintaining faith.

Cheers of Victory 10

Yamamoto arrived unexpectedly on November 9, declaring "I'm here at last! I came to keep my promise to you!" He offered encouragement through prayer, guidance, and piano performances, including "The Three Martyrs of Atsuhara."

The Tokushima location connected historically to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, which premiered in Asia at nearby Naruto during World War I. German POWs at Bando camp exchanged cultural knowledge with locals, exemplifying how "open heart and mind is the most essential qualification for a world citizen."

Volume 30: Chapter 5, Cheers of Victory 21 through 30

Overview

This section from The New Human Revolution documents Shin'ichi Yamamoto's guidance to Soka Gakkai youth and his visit to Oita Prefecture during a period of conflict with opposition priests.

Key Themes

Youth Leadership and Mission

Shin'ichi emphasizes that young people embody the spirit of the Bodhisattvas of the Earth, tasked with spreading kosen-rufu, meaning worldwide Buddhism, in an age of suffering. He calls them to courage and perseverance, stating: "Youth, be not afraid! Vanquish the 'arrogant crashing waves' and surmount all obstacles."

Two New Songs

The chapter chronicles the creation of two divisional songs. "Song of Crimson" was created for the young men's division, celebrating youthful vitality and determination. "This Green Path" was created for young women, completed earlier on November 6. Both songs were designed to inspire youth entering the 21st century.

Resilience Amid Persecution

Shin'ichi visits Oita members who endured harassment from Shoshin-kai priests. He teaches that "changed poison into medicine" transforms suffering into spiritual growth, and that persevering through adversity strengthens one's faith and capacity for happiness.

Mentor-Disciple Bond

Throughout, Shin'ichi emphasizes the importance of unwavering commitment to principles, regardless of criticism or changing circumstances, exemplifying the mentor-disciple relationship as central to Buddhist practice.

Volume 30: Chapter 5, Cheers of Victory 31 through 40

Overview

This chapter from The New Human Revolution documents Shin'ichi's visit to Oita Prefecture in December 1981, following the resolution of conflicts with dissenting priests. The narrative emphasizes leadership development, youth engagement, and the Soka Gakkai's commitment to kosen-rufu, meaning spreading Buddhism.

Key Themes

Leadership and Generational Transition

Shin'ichi addresses the need for leaders to bridge generational differences. He emphasizes that younger and senior leaders must listen to one another respectfully, with leaders acting as "orchestra conductors" who draw out everyone's strengths while maintaining organizational harmony.

Overcoming Persecution

The members had endured significant hardship from hostile priests. Shin'ichi reframes their suffering as a strengthening force, explaining that obstacles deepen faith and enable personal transformation. He references Buddhist teachings showing that slandering practitioners of the Mystic Law produces grave karmic consequences.

Youth and the 21st Century

The centerpiece is Shin'ichi's composition of an extensive poem for young division leaders titled "Youth, Scale the Mountain of Kosen-rufu of the Twenty-First Century." The poem encourages youth to embrace their mission with unwavering faith and declares May 3, 2001 as a target date for victory in the second phase of kosen-rufu.

Correct Faith

Shin'ichi distinguishes between false faith, meaning exploiting the organization for personal gain, fanatical faith, meaning disregarding reason and social norms, and correct faith, which integrates Buddhist practice with wisdom, common sense, and demonstrated social benefit.

Volume 30: Chapter 5, Cheers of Victory 41 through 50

Cheers of Victory 41

Shin'ichi spent December 11 at the Oita Peace Center encouraging members and creating calligraphies for various groups, incorporating names with characters expressing wishes for brilliant growth and steadfast resolve.

He referenced historical figures connected to Oita—including a feudal lord who introduced Western culture, a Confucian scholar who founded an academy, a composer, and an educator—before articulating the Soka Gakkai's unique mission: spreading Nichiren Buddhism's transformative teachings globally and ensuring their eternal transmission.

Cheers of Victory 42

Shin'ichi emphasized that personal criticism was irrelevant; his focus remained on members achieving happiness and benefits through faith. He expressed desire to visit Taketa the next morning before proceeding to Kumamoto, recognizing the severe hardships members endured during the priesthood conflict.

On December 12, he met with regional leaders and stressed the importance of supporting and treasuring members who sacrificed greatly for the movement's development.

Cheers of Victory 43

The journey to Taketa included historical context about Oka Castle—built in 1185 by a nobleman loyal to Minamoto Yoshitsune, later protected by a young lord during sixteenth-century conflict. The castle inspired composer Rentaro Taki's famous composition, which Shin'ichi connected to members' "dauntless fighting spirit" in protecting the Law.

Cheers of Victory 44

Approximately 50 local representatives met with Shin'ichi at a restaurant, sharing experiences of priests' betrayal. One district lost 32 of 45 households when members were persuaded to leave, yet leaders persisted in encouraging members throughout scattered mountain communities.

Cheers of Victory 45

About 300 members gathered at the castle's main enclosure, creating an emotionally resonant atmosphere. Shin'ichi arranged a commemorative photograph and led members in singing "Moon over the Ruined Castle," sharing the emotional weight of their collective victory over adversity.

Cheers of Victory 46

As members sang together, their resilience shone through. Shin'ichi raised his arms in a victory salute, and members responded with three cheers announcing a new era centered on ordinary people rather than institutional authority.

The ruined castle—once symbolizing impermanence and decline—transformed into a beacon of hope and eternal happiness.

Cheers of Victory 47

Members crowded around the departing bus, calling out farewells and affirmations. Shin'ichi waved from the window, maintaining the invisible yet firm bond of faith connecting him with disciples committed to widespread Buddhist practice.

Approaching the Shiragiku Auditorium in Kumamoto, Shin'ichi observed three kites displaying a sunrise, lion, and young eagle—symbols he connected to the auditorium's location.

Cheers of Victory 48

At the Kumamoto meeting, Shin'ichi encountered Hironori Nonaka, a high school student with muscular dystrophy. His mother, Fumino, had overcome hesitation about discussing Buddhism with others after witnessing her son's renewed commitment to practice, successfully introducing another parent to the faith.

Shin'ichi encouraged Nonaka personally, stroking his shoulder and affirming: those refusing to surrender to weakness demonstrate true victory.

Cheers of Victory 49

Nonaka received roses from Shin'ichi the following day, filling him with gratitude. Despite a prognosis of limited lifespan, he resolved to live fully and fulfill his purpose, eventually inspiring peers through presentations about courage and hope despite his illness.

Shin'ichi delivered guidance comparing life's journey to aircraft flight: youth resembles takeoff, maturity represents steady cruising, and final years constitute the crucial landing phase toward attaining enlightenment.

Cheers of Victory 50

He concluded that remaining young at heart while aging, pursuing Buddhist practice wholeheartedly, and helping others achieve happiness represents life's culminating victory. He praised members' sincere efforts, noting the white chrysanthemums' beauty and expressing appreciation for their dedication.

Shin'ichi composed poetry honoring both Kumamoto's young women and Taketa's members before emphasizing personal guidance—earnest dialogue revitalizing individuals at profound depths—as essential for sustained organizational development.

Volume 30: Chapter 5, Cheers of Victory 51 through 60

Cheers of Victory 51

On December 13, Shin'ichi met with approximately 50 divisional representatives and visited the Minamikyushu Women's Center. At an evening prefecture leaders meeting commemorating the Kumamoto Culture Center's fifth anniversary, he praised members from various regions for their dedication to kosen-rufu.

Shin'ichi emphasized that unity of purpose is essential for advancing kosen-rufu. He stressed that "discussion and planning are crucial" and encouraged leaders to return to fundamental questions about their activities' purpose when reaching consensus proves difficult.

Using an airline safety analogy, he explained that members must be guided safely toward lasting happiness. He referenced a teaching from President Toda: those unable to work in harmony within faith will "fall by the wayside."

Cheers of Victory 52

Shin'ichi addressed leaders who had previously disrupted the organization by falsely claiming to be his confidants. He clarified that he treats all members equally regarding faith and that such claims indicate ulterior motives.

He shared the Daishonin's writing: "Even a feeble person will not stumble if those supporting him are strong" and emphasized that supportive fellow members are indispensable for continuing Buddhist practice.

Later, he visited the Seikyo Shimbun editorial office to review the next day's publication featuring a large photograph of Taketa members at Oka Castle.

Cheers of Victory 53

The December 14 edition featured the photograph across two full pages with headlines celebrating the Taketa members' bravery. Many members later framed or treasured the image as a family keepsake.

On December 14, Shin'ichi also visited Fukuoka Prefecture, attending gongyo at the Kurume and Yame Community Centers and visiting Chikugo City. He reaffirmed that difficulties inevitably arise on the path to kosen-rufu and that leaders' presence and behavior during such times prove crucial.

Cheers of Victory 54

Employing Winston Churchill as an example, Shin'ichi discussed leadership qualities. During the London Blitz, Churchill's determined presence inspired Londoners and gave them courage to resist Nazi tyranny.

He drew parallels to the Soka Gakkai's situation, declaring that those attacking the organization are "base, irrational destroyers" requiring "rock-solid conviction" to overcome. He outlined essential leadership qualities: conviction, sincerity, health, workplace excellence, and impartial judgment.

Cheers of Victory 55

On December 15, Shin'ichi met with Nagasaki and Saga prefecture leaders and participated in an open gongyo meeting. Attendees from Kumamoto, Amakusa, Jonan region cities, and four nearby prefectures gathered.

Members from Jonan and Amakusa regions had previously been manipulated by priests into quitting the organization. Despite indignation, members maintained harmony while continuing Buddhist practice and sharing the teaching. They had now begun experiencing hope after their prolonged struggle.

Cheers of Victory 56

The meeting adopted Amakusa and Jonan declarations expressing members' vows for kosen-rufu. Prefecture leaders announced upcoming culture centers and festivals. Shin'ichi then referenced the 1877 Satsuma Rebellion and the Nakatsu Corps' brave but tragic battle, stating his resolve to avoid sacrificing individuals in kosen-rufu efforts.

Cheers of Victory 57

Shin'ichi taught that obstacles arise when dedicating oneself to kosen-rufu because such practice provokes the "persecution" mentioned in the Lotus Sutra. He explained that "obstacles lead to enlightenment," and that adversity can become spiritual assets.

He encouraged members not to pity themselves during difficulties but maintain "a bright, positive spirit" and conviction. Referencing the folk song "Tabaruzaka Hill," he urged members to surmount life's steep passages with determination, comparing youth division members to gallant successors holding both compassion and philosophy.

Cheers of Victory 58

Following his speech, members from Jonan and Amakusa responded with enthusiastic applause and tears. The gathering proceeded to Itchobata Park for a group photograph of 1,500 members.

Shin'ichi proposed they sing "Tabaruzaka Hill" together—a beloved Kumamoto folk song expressing pride in their homeland. Members sang powerfully, reflecting on his guidance and pledging to overcome future adversities.

Cheers of Victory 59

As members sang, memories of their struggles with anti-Soka Gakkai priests surfaced alongside their joy at victory. The photograph was later printed prominently in the December 17 Seikyo Shimbun.

Shin'ichi composed poems for Jonan and Amakusa representatives, acknowledging their endurance through storms and their smiling dedication to kosen-rufu. On December 16, he returned to Tokyo after completing his nine-day Kyushu guidance tour.

Cheers of Victory 60

Shin'ichi remained committed to encouraging members nationwide who had suffered from priesthood-related turmoil and making a fresh start toward the 21st century.

On December 22, he attended a meeting with Odawara and Gotemba representatives at the Kanagawa Training Center in Hakone. These areas had also experienced priest-related harassment but maintained their mentor-disciple bonds.

Members sang "Mount Fuji," aspiring to the mountain's dauntless character. Shin'ichi composed poems encouraging boundless devotion to kosen-rufu. He concluded the year visiting additional Tokyo wards and Yokohama's culture center, embodying the Daishonin's teaching: unceasing effort alone opens the way forward.

Volume 30: Chapter 5, Cheers of Victory 61 through 70

Cheers of Victory 61

The narrative opens with 1982 designated as the "Year of Youth" by the Soka Gakkai. Shin'ichi Yamamoto observes the sunrise from the Kanagawa Culture Center, reflecting on young members he has cultivated who display eagerness to advance the organization's goals.

Shin'ichi composes several poems for the new year, emphasizing the connection between propagating Buddhist teachings and creating lasting historical impact. He attends multiple gongyo sessions across different floors of the culture center to personally encourage participants.

The Soka High School soccer team visits Shin'ichi on his 54th birthday to report their participation in a national tournament. He advises them to play naturally and have fun, recognizing this as the school's inaugural national competition.

Cheers of Victory 62

The soccer team plays their first-round match against Oita Prefecture on January 2. Despite their goalkeeper's knee injury, the team perseveres through a tied match and wins via penalty shootout. In their second-round game on January 4, they lose narrowly to a Hokkaido school but display commendable fighting spirit.

After their loss, a Hokkaido player who is a Soka Gakkai member thanks the Soka coach and introduces himself, exemplifying the youth values emphasized throughout the narrative.

Cheers of Victory 63

Shin'ichi continues intensive New Year activities across multiple prefectures. On January 9, he attends a Tokyo Metropolitan Area high school division gongyo session at headquarters, reflecting on members' growth since 1965.

He visits the Meguro Peace Center to meet with representatives facing challenges from opposition priests. Shin'ichi emphasizes the importance of courageous dialogue and steadfast faith amid difficulties.

Cheers of Victory 64

At the Meguro gathering, Shin'ichi addresses the suffering members have endured from anti-Soka Gakkai priests motivated by envy. He stresses that "action is key" and that resolute leadership can overcome obstacles.

Shin'ichi defines correct faith as "unwavering belief in the Gohonzon throughout one's life, regardless of circumstances." He encourages members to engage in Buddhist dialogue with courage. That year, Meguro members would achieve the nation's top recruitment results with 1,115 new households.

Cheers of Victory 65

On January 10, Shin'ichi travels to snowy Akita Prefecture despite winter conditions. He refuses to be dissuaded, determined to support members facing severe harassment from opposition priests similar to those in Oita.

Upon arrival, Shin'ichi immediately engages with waiting members despite the harsh weather and icy conditions, demonstrating his commitment through direct action rather than words alone.

Cheers of Victory 66

Shin'ichi stops the car multiple times on the route to the Akita Culture Center to meet with members waiting by roadsides. He offers encouragement, shakes hands, and takes photographs with groups gathered at various locations.

One member expresses unwavering conviction, stating: "Nothing anyone says can shake our faith. We are lions!" Shin'ichi stops nine times total during this journey to personally meet with approximately a thousand people.

Cheers of Victory 67

At an auto factory gathering, Shin'ichi praises local leaders who have protected members against priests' interference. He emphasizes the principle of "many in body, one in mind" and quotes Nichiren's teachings about maintaining faith despite difficulties.

He warns against easily swayed members and encourages leaders to embrace everyone warmly while maintaining careful, respectful language. Regional leader Akio Yamanaka observes that Shin'ichi teaches through embodying the spirit of encouragement rather than mere words.

Cheers of Victory 68

At the Akita Culture Center, Shin'ichi conducts ceremonies for a monument and tree-planting. When asked to name the plaza, he suggests "Sunny Skies" as a symbol of how "storms and blizzards always end and sunny days return," mirroring how Buddhist practice ensures positive life outcomes.

The name resonates deeply with leaders, reflecting back to 1972 when Shin'ichi visited during destructive flooding, emphasizing faith's power to transform difficulties.

Cheers of Victory 69

A Tohoku conference reports the cruel treatment Soka Gakkai members endured from opposition priests. Examples include priests conditioning funeral services on members leaving the organization and callously blaming a grieving woman's loss on her faith.

Shin'ichi expresses deep respect for members' fortitude and emphasizes that leaders must treat members "with the same respect shown to a Buddha," requiring considerate language and thoughtful actions.

Cheers of Victory 70

The following day, Shin'ichi visits the Akita Community Center to appreciate youth who prepared a peace exhibition over the New Year holidays. He then visits the family of Koji Sato, Akita's first chapter leader.

The narrative concludes with Sato's meeting with Josei Toda, where Toda's direct statement—"I entrust Akita to you!"—moves Sato to commit wholeheartedly. The passage emphasizes that "life-to-life communication moves the human heart" more effectively than abstract principles.

Volume 30: Chapter 5, Cheers of Victory 71 through 80

Cheers of Victory 71

A man named Sato joined the Soka Gakkai and became deeply involved in activities. His in-laws, who held leadership positions, visited Akita regularly despite the 12-hour journey, teaching members the fundamentals of faith through personal guidance.

In 1954, the first large group in Akita was established with 800 households. Two years later, it became Akita Chapter, with Sato appointed as chapter leader and his sister Tetsuyo as chapter women's leader.

Sato operated a drilling business. In January 1955, Josei Toda asked him to search for groundwater at the head temple, where finding safe drinking water had become urgent. Despite months of drilling to 200 meters in various locations, Sato found nothing. Toda explained that water was needed to support the priesthood and protect members as "children of the Buddha."

Cheers of Victory 72

Sato continued chanting with determination. Eventually, he struck water at just 26 meters depth—a miraculous discovery. The water flowed at 216 liters per minute, enabling the temple to provide water throughout its grounds.

In January 1979, Shin'ichi visited Akita and met with Sato, who had been diagnosed with lung cancer two years prior. Shin'ichi encouraged him: "Make the closing chapter of your life like a magnificent, radiant sunset."

Sato rose to the challenge, visiting members' homes and offering guidance. He died the following May at age 66, three years after diagnosis, "demonstrating the Buddhist principle of prolonging one's life through faith."

Over a year later, Shin'ichi visited Sato's family, performing gongyo and praising Sato's "fine character and wholehearted faith."

Cheers of Victory 73

Shin'ichi spoke warmly to the family about continuing Sato's legacy, describing it as "a relay race" where they must keep running to reach the finish line. He encouraged them to demonstrate "actual proof" so others would recognize the Sato family's commitment.

On January 11, Shin'ichi addressed an Akita Prefecture conference at the Culture Center, discussing what constitutes genuine Buddhist practice: maintaining a spirit that says, "Whatever happens, I will sit before the Gohonzon and chant," while remaining centered on kosen-rufu.

He warned against those who become self-centered and use faith for selfish purposes, noting that "their true nature is always exposed in the end."

Cheers of Victory 74

Shin'ichi shared candidly about being deceived by people over his decades of practice, yet choosing to embrace them with tolerance. However, he emphasized that those acting with ill intent—"causing suffering to fellow members" and "undermining the movement"—must be resolutely opposed.

He explained that all actions are governed by cause and effect, the fundamental law of Buddhism. He then addressed criticism from priests and others, noting that distorted perspectives cannot perceive the Soka Gakkai truthfully, comparing this to how "evil people saw Shakyamuni Buddha" with twisted perception.

Cheers of Victory 75

After speaking, Shin'ichi acknowledged Tomiko Sekiya, a women's division guidance leader. He recalled her courageous stand in February 1978 when priests tried preventing Soka Gakkai members from entering the temple. Sekiya boldly questioned their actions and defended the organization despite having no senior mentors to consult.

Shin'ichi praised her conviction, stating: "Being an onlooker rather than someone who takes personal initiative...is a mark of cowardice."

Cheers of Victory 76

Shin'ichi told Sekiya they would meet many times before the year 2001, when she would be 81. He promised: "Your name will shine forever in the history of kosen-rufu."

He later sent her a poem about living together into the new century "as Bodhisattvas of the Earth."

The next day, a prefecture leaders meeting celebrated the Culture Center opening. Representatives from Oita Prefecture attended, and the two prefectures agreed to form a sister relationship and build a "rainbow bridge of kosen-rufu."

Shin'ichi emphasized that the fundamental purpose of Buddhist practice is achieving personal happiness, which comes through faith and Soka Gakkai activities.

Cheers of Victory 77

Shin'ichi reflected on memory, explaining that most fade with time, but "memories of practicing Buddhism...will endure...as the very best for all eternity." He cited the Daishonin: "Single-mindedly chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and urge others to do the same."

He described his own experiences leading campaigns and mentioned his desire for all members to participate in gongyo sessions. He decided to hold multiple sessions the next day, open to everyone.

Cheers of Victory 78

Snow fell on January 13 as Akita members gathered from across the prefecture. After attending a morning conference, Shin'ichi returned to join members for photographs in the park.

The Akita members had endured significant hardships. Anti-Soka Gakkai priests demanded members leave the organization in exchange for funeral services and delivered vitriolic speeches at funerals. Some cruelly asserted the deceased had not attained Buddhahood.

Despite these trials, members now embarked on a new journey toward the 21st century alongside Shin'ichi.

Cheers of Victory 79

Approximately 1,500 members gathered as Shin'ichi arrived in a white parka in minus 2.2 degrees Celsius weather. He suggested they sing the "Song of Human Revolution" as "a declaration of Akita's great victory."

After the song, he proposed a victory cheer. Members raised their voices powerfully, celebrating their triumph as snow fell around them "like a whirling shower of blossoms."

The afternoon gongyo session emphasized that faith, practice, and study form the basics of Nichiren Buddhism. Shin'ichi announced the formation of an Akita Educators Group and praised the Ota Area members for their exceptional progress in kosen-rufu.

Cheers of Victory 80

Joryo Komatsuda was the first district leader in Ota Area. He learned about Nichiren Buddhism in 1953 from his son, who had encountered it in Tokyo. Joryo's wife suffered poor health, and his eldest son had experienced tragic losses.

Though financially comfortable, Joryo felt dejected. Learning about cause and effect through Nichiren Buddhism, he, his wife, and eldest son became the area's first three Soka Gakkai members.

As his wife practiced regularly, her health improved and laughter filled their home. Inspired by the members' positive spirits, Joryo became convinced of faith's power and eagerly shared Buddhism with others, beginning with a cousin.

By his 10th year of practice, 47 families connected to him had joined, and the southern prefecture membership reached approximately 4,700 households.

In 1963, Joryo's ancestral home burned while he was away. Some questioned how such a disaster could happen to a sincere practitioner. Joryo responded with confidence: "I'm fine, so don't worry. I have the Gohonzon!"

Volume 30: Chapter 5, Cheers of Victory 81 through 89

Overview

This chapter documents Shin'ichi's guidance tours through Akita and Ibaraki prefectures in January and February 1982, focusing on encouraging members facing priesthood opposition and fostering young leaders for future kosen-rufu activities.

Key Sections

Akita Prefecture Visit, January 12 through 15

Shin'ichi visited Akita to honor pioneer members like Joryo Komatsuda, an 84-year-old who had dedicated decades to introducing people to Nichiren Buddhism. The narrative emphasizes that "the phenomenal development of the Soka Gakkai has been achieved thanks to countless such unsung heroes."

Participants were organized into groups—the "Snowstorm Group" and "Whirlwind Group"—recognizing their efforts despite severe weather conditions.

Youth Division Emphasis

Shin'ichi stressed to young leaders the importance of using time wisely and pursuing activities aligned with their values. He encouraged creative problem-solving, suggesting an international agricultural forum and proposing innovative uses of Akita's natural resources like snow.

The youth were designated the "1st Class of 2001," establishing a goal to advance together toward May 3, 2001. Shin'ichi stated: "I fully entrust the future of kosen-rufu to you, the youth."

Ibaraki Prefecture Visit, February 7 through 12

This region faced severe challenges from priesthood attacks and member defections. Shin'ichi addressed the root causes of lost faith, identifying "arrogance" as a primary factor leading leaders astray. He emphasized that positions don't confer superiority, and that "steady faith" and sincere daily practice determine true victory.

The chapter concludes with the affirmation that "members had won" and had "overcome another towering trial."
