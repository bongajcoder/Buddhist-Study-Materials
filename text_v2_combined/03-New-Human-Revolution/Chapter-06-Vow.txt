Chapter 6: Vow

Volume 30: Chapter 6, Vow 1 through 10

Vow 1

Youth development forms the foundation of organizational growth. The Soka Gakkai emphasizes nurturing young people with conviction in their Buddhist faith and awareness of their mission as practitioners. Culture festivals serve as celebrations expressing "the joy and vitality gained through their practice of Nichiren Buddhism." The first Kansai Youth Peace Culture Festival occurred on March 22, 1982, at Nagai Stadium in Osaka, following the historically significant 1966 "Kansai Culture Festival in the Rain" at Koshien Stadium.

Vow 2

The 1982 festival was originally scheduled for two days but rain cancelled the March 21 session. Leadership encouraged participants by noting that postponement prevented excessive strain on members attempting a challenging six-tier human pyramid formation. Safety protocols included careful site preparation, physical conditioning programs, and earnest collective chanting to ensure success without accidents.

Vow 3

On March 22, the festival opened with 10,000 newly joined youth members marching in a "procession of peace." Performances included a 2,000-member chorus, ballet, fife and drum corps displays, rhythmic calisthenics, traditional Japanese dance, historical presentations, and gymnastics. The climax featured 4,000 young men forming multiple pyramids, culminating in an ambitious six-tier formation.

Vow 4

The pyramid construction required precise coordination across all tiers. As each level stood upright, supporting increasing weight, a helicopter overhead created unexpected wind challenges. The final member struggled briefly to reach the sixth tier but ultimately succeeded, prompting stadium-wide applause and celebration.

Vow 5

Koji Ueno, a team member, had suffered a serious stroke on March 6 and passed away on March 17, five days before the festival. His final words—"We'll make the impossible possible!"—became the team's inspiration. Ueno's friend Hiroyuki Kikuta honored him by participating fully. The gymnasium team achieved their first successful six-tier pyramid on March 18, the day after learning of Ueno's passing.

Vow 6

Ueno's wife reflected on her husband's "irrefutable testimony of faith" and his dedication to Buddhist practice until death. Team members included Ueno's name in the festival resolutions, with his wife writing on his behalf: "Kosen-rufu is my life!" Participants drew strength from overcoming personal weaknesses through chanting and mutual encouragement, embodying the "Kansai spirit of breaking through impossible barriers."

Vow 7

The Kansai spirit originated from Josei Toda's determination to eliminate poverty and suffering in Osaka. Shin'ichi Yamamoto inherited this mission, leading the region to remarkable growth—11,111 new households joined in May 1956. In July 1957, Yamamoto's arrest on election law charges sparked massive protests, forging members' commitment to justice and people's happiness.

Vow 8

Toda's peace-focused philosophy shaped the Kansai movement. Yamamoto carried this spirit forward, actualizing happiness for countless people despite government opposition. The youth peace festival declaration pledged to spread Nichiren Buddhism globally and advance disarmament efforts, building on Toda's 1957 nuclear weapons abolition declaration.

Vow 9

The Soka Gakkai's peace movement rests on establishing "defenses of peace" through Buddhist principles respecting human dignity. Nichiren Buddhism teaches that all people possess Buddha nature equally worthy of respect. Members practice daily human revolution, transforming negative karma while contributing to societal betterment.

Vow 10

Mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki praised the Soka Gakkai's long-standing peace commitment and Yamamoto's dialogues with world leaders. UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar commended the organization's role as an NGO in promoting disarmament. The Soka Gakkai Peace Committee, established January 26, 1982, expanded peace activities toward the 21st century.

Volume 30: Chapter 6, Vow 11 through 20

Vow 11

Shin'ichi Yamamoto addressed the Kansai Youth Peace Culture Festival, expressing the Soka Gakkai's commitment to peace based on Nichiren Buddhism. He encouraged youth to overcome slander and criticism, stating they should become trustworthy in their communities. The festival concluded with celebration, though tensions soon emerged when High Priest Nikken Abe summoned Shin'ichi, objecting to language about "elevating" the Daishonin's Buddhism as disrespectful.

Vow 12

Nikken further criticized Shin'ichi's choice of titles in his remarks. Despite this confrontation, Shin'ichi remained committed to maintaining priesthood-laity harmony. The First Chubu Youth Peace Culture Festival followed on April 29, drawing 70,000 youth. Despite rain forecasts, clear skies emerged, and UN officials praised the event's demonstration that "peace isn't something created in some distant part of the world, but something we must work to build" locally.

Vow 13

As final speaker, Shin'ichi emphasized the importance of having "a solid philosophy" and returning to basic questions about life's purpose and peace. He encouraged participants to "be reliable and trustworthy people in your workplaces, schools, homes, and communities." The festival represented the fulfillment of a shared vow between Shin'ichi and his mentor Josei Toda to establish Chubu as a fortress for kosen-rufu.

Vow 14

The Second World Peace Culture Festival occurred September 18 and 19, 1982, at Seibu Lions Stadium with 40,000 youth participants, including 3,000 from international locations. Shin'ichi walked the rain-misted field without an umbrella to thank performers, expressing parental concern for the youth's wellbeing above all else.

Vow 15

Performances included "Sparkling Eyes," group gymnastics titled "Soaring Flight," and a card art display spelling "Waves of Peace." The young women's division performed the "Dance of Torches" with 600 lights. UN Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar sent a message emphasizing that NGOs "have an extremely important role to play in helping generate public support for the United Nations."

Vow 16

Throughout 1982, the Soka Gakkai launched numerous peace initiatives including youth lectures, exhibitions on war experiences, refugee assistance campaigns, and exhibitions about the United Nations. A 50-person delegation traveled to New York for the UN's special disarmament session, including atomic bomb survivors who shared their experiences. The "Nuclear Threat to Our World" exhibition was displayed at UN headquarters.

Vow 17

The nuclear exhibition contained three sections: destruction in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, factual nuclear information, and disarmament and development. It drew over 200,000 viewers including UN officials and diplomats. The exhibition subsequently traveled internationally, eventually being shown in 25 cities across 16 countries by 1988, viewed by over 1.2 million people.

Vow 18

Following guidance from Josei Toda about making concrete peace proposals, Shin'ichi issued his "Proposal for Disarmament and the Abolition of Nuclear Arms" during the 1982 UN special session on disarmament. He proposed that NGOs help facilitate disarmament and called for non-nuclear states to secure commitments against preemptive strikes. Beginning in 1983, he issued annual peace proposals on SGI Day.

Vow 19

In May 1983, the SGI obtained NGO consultative status with the UN Economic and Social Council. That August, Shin'ichi received the United Nations Peace Award from UN Under-Secretary-General Yasushi Akashi. Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar cited his efforts promoting "understanding and friendship among nations" and making "constructive proposals for the relaxation of international tension." Later, Shin'ichi received the UNHCR Humanitarian Award in 1989.

Vow 20

The Soka Gakkai's peace activism traces to founding president Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, who resisted militarist pressure to enshrine Shinto talismans, resulting in his 1943 arrest and death in prison in 1944. His disciple Josei Toda issued a 1957 declaration calling nuclear weapons an "absolute evil." Nichiren Buddhism's emphasis on human value over state authority provided the spiritual foundation for these principled stands on human rights and peace.

Volume 30: Chapter 6, Vow 21 through 30

Vow 21

Nichiren Daishonin dedicated himself to alleviating human suffering and promoting kosen-rufu globally. Josei Toda articulated a vision of humanity as one interconnected family in February 1952, reflecting Nichiren Buddhist ideals. SGI members practice a philosophy valuing everyone's equality and happiness, taking compassionate action toward those in distress.

The 1982 Falkland Islands conflict between the UK and Argentina lasted several weeks with over 900 casualties. Despite their nations' military opposition, SGI-UK and SGI-Argentina leaders—who had trained together in Japan—chanted jointly for peace. Eleanor Roosevelt observed that "If peace is going to come about in the world, the way to start is by getting a better understanding between individuals."

Vow 22

SGI-UK General Director Raymond Gordon reported that members in both countries prayed earnestly for the war's end. Gordon prayed for Britain to transform its karma. While the conflict continued, he visited Nagasaki's Peace Park, laying a wreath and praying for atomic bomb victims and lasting peace.

In March 1983, SGI-UK held a London peace exhibition titled "Choose Life," receiving BBC and major press coverage. A year later, SGI-UK and SGI-Argentina representatives participated in joint training in Tokyo, pledging continued cooperation for global peace.

Vow 23

Shin'ichi Yamamoto believed grassroots kosen-rufu activities, rooted in ordinary people's lives, created foundations for lasting peace. He engaged with world leaders while prioritizing educational exchanges with universities, recognizing that student networks would become forces for global unity.

Between 1983 and 1984, Yamamoto visited the United States, Europe, and South America. He returned to Brazil after 18 years, meeting President Joao Figueiredo on February 21, 1984, in Brasilia. Previously, Brazil's military government had denied his visa application due to misunderstandings about the Soka Gakkai.

Vow 24

SGI-Brazil members had worked for a decade to build trust and understanding. Despite earlier suspicion, President Figueiredo now welcomed Yamamoto, discussing scientific cooperation, Brazil's democratic transition, nuclear weapons, and the importance of leader-to-leader dialogue for peace.

Yamamoto met numerous government officials, donated books to the University of Brasilia, and addressed 600 members. On February 25, at Ibirapuera Gymnasium's culture festival rehearsal, he expressed deep emotion reuniting with members after 18 years, commending their efforts and solidarity.

Vow 25

The SGI-Brazil Grand Culture Festival on February 26 featured "Song of Peace for the World in the 21st Century." President Figueiredo's message acknowledged the organization's cultural, educational, and peace contributions—stark contrast to his predecessors' suspicion. This exemplified "changing poison into medicine."

In Peru, Yamamoto met President Fernando Belaunde Terry and received the Order of the Sun of Peru. He also visited the National University of San Marcos, donating books and strengthening educational ties. The university later awarded him an honorary doctorate in 2017.

Vow 26

At the 1st SGI-Peru World Peace Youth Culture Festival on March 3, 1984, Yamamoto addressed approximately 10,000 youth, stating "Culture is the flower of the nation. Cultural activities are equivalent to activities for peace." He noted a rainbow over Lima symbolized Peru's bright future.

He praised late General Director Vicente Seiken Kishibe and taught that faith in the Mystic Law brings happiness and national flourishing. In February 1987, Yamamoto visited the Dominican Republic, meeting President Joaquin Balaguer and receiving the Order of Christopher Columbus.

Vow 27

At a commemorative gongyo session for Dominican kosen-rufu's 21st anniversary, Yamamoto encouraged pioneer members who had endured hardship establishing the movement. He attended the First SGI-Dominican Republic General Meeting.

The Autonomous University of Santo Domingo presented him with an honorary professorship in Law and Political Science on February 10, 1987. Yamamoto laid a wreath at Independence Park's memorial to founding fathers.

During his Panama visit from February 17 through 20, he met President Eric Arturo Delvalle, receiving the Order of Vasco Nunez de Balboa. He visited the University of Panama, which later awarded him an honorary doctorate in 2000.

Vow 28

Yamamoto prioritized meetings with world leaders, believing such dialogue advanced peace and protected SGI members. In 1985, he met Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. In May 1987, he attended a nuclear arms exhibition opening in Moscow and spoke with Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov.

He met French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac and other European leaders. In 1988, he met Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, and Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. He lectured at Paris's Institut de France on "Art and Spirituality in the East and the West."

Vow 29

In May 1990, during his seventh China visit, Yamamoto spoke with Premier Li Peng and General Secretary Jiang Zemin. That July, meeting President Mikhail Gorbachev at the Kremlin—his first Soviet visit since becoming leader—Yamamoto said playfully, "I have come to have an argument with you."

Gorbachev responded warmly, expressing respect for Yamamoto's humanistic work. Yamamoto noted that twenty-five years earlier he had proposed "humanistic socialism," which paralleled Gorbachev's vision of "socialism with a human face," both grounded in shared humanity.

Vow 30

Gorbachev praised Yamamoto's "intellectual and social activities" and peace movement, emphasizing their "spiritual aspect." Both leaders discussed integrating morality and ethics into governance, the alliance of politics and culture, Soviet-Japan relations, perestroika's significance, and hopes for youth.

Yamamoto invited Gorbachev to visit Japan, mentioning Japanese women's hopes he would visit "in the spring when the cherry trees are in bloom, or in the fall when the autumn leaves are so lovely." Gorbachev agreed enthusiastically, committing to spring travel and opening "the doors to a new age."

Volume 30: Chapter 6, Vow 31 through 40

Vow 31

Shin'ichi met with Soviet President Gorbachev, who emphasized that dialogue works best when both parties abandon power dynamics and speak openly about problems. Their 70-minute conversation received worldwide coverage through major Soviet media outlets and Japanese broadcasters.

In April 1991, Gorbachev visited Japan as promised. Shin'ichi praised the Soviet leader's sacrifices in pursuing perestroika, and both expressed hopes for strengthened friendship between their nations.

Vow 32

Shin'ichi welcomed Nelson Mandela at the Seikyo Shimbun building in Tokyo on October 31, 1990, where approximately 500 youth gathered. Mandela, who spent over 27 years imprisoned for fighting apartheid, later became South Africa's president in 1994.

Shin'ichi expressed profound respect for Mandela's achievements and noted his creation of educational opportunities within prison—what he called a "Mandela University." He emphasized that "anywhere can be a place of learning" for those committed to self-improvement.

Vow 33

Mandela responded warmly to Shin'ichi, calling their meeting "a source of illumination, strength, and hope." Shin'ichi proposed several initiatives to support the anti-apartheid movement, including welcoming ANC students to Soka University, hosting cultural performances, and organizing exhibitions on human rights and apartheid.

He stressed that changing public awareness proves essential for advancing human rights protections globally.

Vow 34

Soka University presented Mandela with its Award of Highest Honor. Shin'ichi discussed the Buddhist concept of "human flowers" from the Lotus Sutra, explaining how Buddhism has historically opposed all forms of discrimination based on caste, race, ethnicity, or background.

He presented Mandela with a poem expressing admiration for his "indomitable strength" and calling him a "comrade in spirit."

Vow 35

When Shin'ichi read Mandela's famous words—"I have fought against White domination...I have cherished the ideal of a democratic...society"—Mandela responded deeply. He stated that wisdom is imperishable, unlike medals or certificates, and promised never to forget their encounter.

Genuine dialogue creates mutual inspiration and illumination between committed leaders.

Vow 36

As their meeting concluded, Shin'ichi told Mandela that great leaders face persecution but that true justice emerges over centuries. Their hearts resonated as both fought for humanity's welfare.

Following this meeting, Shin'ichi intensified his citizen diplomacy efforts, meeting with numerous African, European, and Asian leaders throughout late 1990 and 1991, including Presidents Kaunda, Gowon, and Aquino.

Vow 37

Beyond political leaders, Shin'ichi engaged with prominent academics, artists, and educators from every continent during 1990 and 1991. He met figures including UNESCO Director Federico Mayor and Harvard Professor John Montgomery.

He composed poems for many leaders, including Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai's widow, Soviet President Gorbachev, Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, and former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. He wrote for Philippine President Aquino: "The person who truly protects the people will find the people on her side."

Vow 38

Shin'ichi composed lengthy poems to encourage SGI members worldwide pursuing kosen-rufu. In 1987 alone, he created poems dedicated to members in various countries—from "Arise, the Sun of the Century" for SGI-USA to "A Rainbow over Niagara" for SGI-Canada.

His poems offered practical guidance on faith and character development, emphasizing that "faith is manifested in your daily life" and encouraging members to polish their character to expand the Law's influence.

Vow 39

In the decade since 1979, Shin'ichi had traveled extensively to create momentum for kosen-rufu and world peace. The world now approached a major turning point—the Cold War's conclusion.

The division between Eastern and Western blocs originated from the 1945 Yalta Conference where Allied leaders carved the postwar world into spheres of influence. This framework led to nuclear tensions, the Berlin Wall's construction in 1961, and the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.

Division perpetuates division, making a unifying philosophy centered on shared humanity essential.

Vow 40

Shin'ichi remained confident that history would move toward peace and unity. In 1968, he proposed normalizing Japan-China relations and admitting China to the United Nations, believing isolation would harm global peace.

Between 1974 and December, he visited both countries privately, conveying messages between Chinese and Soviet leaders seeking reconciliation. All efforts stemmed from his conviction that resolving superpower conflicts served humanity's wellbeing.

The passage concludes: "Nothing can be achieved by giving up. Peace is a struggle against resignation."

Volume 30: Chapter 6, Vow 41 through 50

Vow 41

Shin'ichi Yamamoto pursued peace between China and the Soviet Union during the 1970s. Though Cold War tensions temporarily increased in the 1980s following Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and the subsequent Olympic boycotts, Yamamoto continued advocating for dialogue between superpowers. When Mikhail Gorbachev implemented glasnost and perestroika beginning in 1985, Yamamoto recognized these reforms as pivotal. "When both sides are serious about peace, it is possible for them to surmount their differences and reach accord, just as rivers flowing on different courses eventually merge into the ocean."

Vow 42

Gorbachev's reforms catalyzed historic change across Eastern Europe. The 1989 revolutions brought down communist governments in Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia. On November 9, 1989, the Berlin Wall fell—fulfilling a prediction Yamamoto had made in 1961. The Malta Summit in December between Bush and Gorbachev officially marked the Cold War's end. Yamamoto remembered his conviction that conscience and wisdom would ultimately triumph over division.

Vow 43

Gorbachev became the Soviet Union's first president in 1990 and received the Nobel Peace Prize. However, his reforms created unforeseen challenges. He explained to Yamamoto: "The first thing that perestroika has brought is freedom. But the challenge before us now is how we use that freedom." Ethnic conflicts and economic difficulties emerged as societies grappled with newly granted liberties.

Vow 44

Boris Yeltsin defeated a hard-line communist coup in August 1991. Gorbachev's power subsequently diminished as Yeltsin's influence grew. By December 1991, the Soviet Union officially dissolved, replaced by the Commonwealth of Independent States. Though criticized, Gorbachev's leadership had brought democratic freedoms to Eastern Europe and fundamentally redirected global history.

Vow 45

Writer Chinghiz Aitmatov shared a parable with Gorbachev illustrating the consequences of choosing freedom over authoritarian control. A prophet presented a lord with two paths: consolidating power or granting freedom to the people. The second path meant enduring ingratitude, public mockery, and betrayal from former allies. Gorbachev responded: "I will hold to my course no matter what. Democracy, freedom, and deliverance from the horrors of the past...are the only way for me."

Vow 46

Post-Cold War challenges persisted despite Soviet collapse. Ethnic conflicts erupted in Yugoslavia, Azerbaijan, and Chechnya. Terrorism increased. Yamamoto emphasized that "the road to peace is a perilous one—which is why we must never halt our progress toward achieving it." He promoted international dialogue and UN-led systems for establishing global peace and security.

Vow 47

The Soka Gakkai faced attacks from Shoshin-kai priests but maintained steady momentum. Yamamoto experienced personal tragedy when his son Hisahiro died unexpectedly on October 3, 1984, at age 29. Though devastated, Yamamoto maintained faith that his son's brief life held profound meaning aligned with his spiritual mission for kosen-rufu.

Vow 48

In October 1985, Yamamoto underwent medical examination following health concerns. Recognizing he approached 58—the age his mentor Josei Toda died—he renewed his determination: he possessed a global mission requiring robust health and longevity. He reflected that suffering itself strengthens spiritual practice: "the harder we continue to strive without letting difficulties defeat us, the more our spirits are forged, strengthened, and deepened."

Vow 49

Criminal proceedings against former Soka Gakkai legal counsel Tomomasa Yamawaki concluded when the Tokyo District Court sentenced him to three years imprisonment in March 1985 for extortion. The court found he had fabricated evidence and "colluded with activist priests" against the organization. His appeals failed, with the Supreme Court finalizing the sentence in January 1991 after a decade-long process.

Vow 50

Yamamoto worked to strengthen priesthood-laity relations and promote Nichiren Shoshu's development. The Soka Gakkai announced plans to build 200 new temples within a decade, completing 111 by December 1990. Yamamoto emphasized that dedicated lay practitioners embody the Bodhisattva ideal, deserving respect equivalent to Buddha veneration according to Lotus Sutra teachings.

Volume 30: Chapter 6, Vow 51 through 60

Vow 51

In summer 1990, Soka Gakkai youth members prepared a culture festival at the head temple celebrating Taiseki-ji's 700th anniversary. The September 2 event featured performances by arts and youth divisions, with members from 67 countries parading in traditional costumes. Honorary President Shin'ichi Yamamoto attended alongside High Priest Nikken. The text notes that no one anticipated the priesthood's December plot to drive a wedge between Yamamoto and members and destroy the organization.

Following the festival, Yamamoto engaged in numerous meetings with international figures, including Chinese delegates, UN officials, and cultural leaders, advancing his vision for worldwide kosen-rufu and world peace.

Vow 52

On September 21, Yamamoto visited South Korea for the first time, attending the opening of a Western oil painting exhibition from the Tokyo Fuji Art Museum at Seoul's Ho-Am Gallery. He viewed this as cultural repayment for Korea's historical contributions to Japan and as fostering mutual understanding between nations.

After departing Seoul on September 22, Yamamoto traveled through Kyushu prefectures before returning to Tokyo on October 2. He then attended the 700th anniversary grand ceremony sessions at Taiseki-ji on October 6 and 7, where the Soka Gakkai's donated chandelier—an eight-petaled lotus measuring 5.4 meters in diameter—was lit in the Grand Reception Hall.

Vow 53

High Priest Nikken praised the Soka Gakkai's achievements during the anniversary ceremony, stating: "In particular, the rise of the lay organization the Soka Gakkai in recent years has led to the correct teaching spreading throughout Japan and the world."

After the ceremonies concluded, Nikken presented Yamamoto with a certificate of appreciation and commemorative items. However, "it was only a short time later that Nikken and his supporters set into motion their plot to destroy the Soka Gakkai."

Yamamoto continued engaging with global leaders in peace, culture, and education during this period, building bridges toward the 21st century following the Cold War's end.

Vow 54

On December 13, Yamamoto met with Sverre Lodgaard of the Peace Research Institute Oslo to discuss environmental security and human revolution. Simultaneously, a priesthood-Soka Gakkai liaison session occurred in Tokyo, where the priesthood presented written questions about Yamamoto's November 16 speech on spreading teachings and developing as a world religious movement.

The priesthood criticized Yamamoto's proposal for large-scale performances of Beethoven's "Ode to Joy," claiming that "singing 'Ode to Joy' in German constitutes praise for the Christian God."

Vow 55

On December 23, the Soka Gakkai responded to the priesthood's inquiry, seeking clarification on matters troubling their relationship. They raised nine points including statements by the high priest and priestly misconduct.

The priesthood's December 26 response condemned the Gakkai's letter as containing "baseless accusations" and "absolutely shameless."

On December 27, the priesthood revised Nichiren Shoshu rules, limiting the chief representative term to five years and other lay officers to three years. They immediately revoked the positions of Yamamoto and other senior Gakkai leaders. This action was announced to media on December 28, before official notification reached those affected.

Vow 56

Soka Gakkai members learned through newspapers that Yamamoto and senior leaders had been removed from their positions through rule revisions. They reacted with surprise and anger at the priesthood's actions.

The official removal notice arrived December 29. The Gakkai held emergency leaders meetings throughout Japan to explain the situation.

In 1991, designated the Year of Peace and Development, Yamamoto composed New Year's poems emphasizing "dauntless courage" and overcoming "jealousy's tempests." Soka Gakkai members held spirited New Year's gongyo meetings in Japan and 75 countries worldwide.

Vow 57

On January 2, President Akizuki and General Director Morikawa requested a meeting with Nikken but were refused. Nichiren Shoshu declared the Gakkai leaders "unworthy of an audience."

A January 12 priesthood letter acknowledged several errors and retracted some questions, collapsing their argument's foundation. Yet they refused to amend their actions against the Soka Gakkai, asserting that promoting "equality between priests and laity" constituted "one of the five cardinal sins."

The Soka Gakkai demanded a public apology and continued requesting dialogue, citing Nichiren Daishonin's teaching to "discuss the question at length."

Vow 58

The Soka Gakkai's commitment to dialogue reflects its philosophy respecting all people and faith in humanity, grounded in Nichiren Buddhism's egalitarian principles teaching that "all people equally possess the Buddha nature."

The priesthood, conversely, subscribed to attitudes from Japan's traditional parish system regarding priests as superior to lay followers, seeking to subjugate Soka Gakkai members to Nichiren Shoshu authority.

The Lotus Sutra teaches equality, overturning discrimination. Nichiren Daishonin affirmed: "Anyone who teaches others even a single phrase of the Lotus Sutra is the envoy of the Thus Come One, whether that person be priest or layman, nun or laywoman."

The priesthood's dogmatic attitude extended beyond rejecting Beethoven's composition to criticizing photographs of British ceremonial dress containing Christian symbols, demonstrating cultural insensitivity that obstructed mutual understanding.

Vow 59

All human endeavors—culture, arts, customs, and traditions—have been influenced by religion. Western calendars, Sunday holidays, stained glass, and architectural styles all reflect Christian heritage. Rejecting all such elements would make functioning in society impossible.

Buddhism teaches adapting to local customs and times, respecting present traditions in each country provided they don't violate core principles. As long as practitioners uphold the Gohonzon, engage in faith and practice, and dedicate themselves to kosen-rufu, they should maintain flexible attitudes toward local culture.

Schiller's "Ode to Joy" uses the plural "gods," not praising a particular deity. Shin'ichi proposed performing this work with 50,000 members on the Gakkai's 65th anniversary and 100,000 on the 70th, eventually singing it in German alongside Japanese.

Vow 60

Beethoven's Ninth Symphony and its "Ode to Joy" symbolize freedom and unity globally. The 1989 Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia featured the composition celebrating the end of communist rule. December 1989 Berlin concerts reuniting musicians from East and West Germany, plus allied nations, performed the symphony celebrating German reunification.

Scholars refuted the priesthood's objection. Professor Haruo Kawabata noted: "Art is a sublimation of the universal human spirit. To subject it to the categories of petty religious dogmatism and condemn its appreciators as heretics is an example of the narrow-minded self-righteousness that produced the witch-hunts of former eras."

Schiller's use of plural "gods" referenced ancient Greek ideals representing humanity's highest qualities, not Christian monotheism.

Volume 30: Chapter 6, Vow 61 through 70

Vow 61

Japanese author Hidehiko Ushijima argued that culture and religion maintain distinct roles. He contended that dismissing works like Beethoven's Ninth Symphony as heretical reflects dogmatism that undermines religious practice. Ushijima warned that Nichiren Shoshu's rigid approach would prevent global propagation of Buddhist teachings.

The Soka Gakkai observed troubling patterns among Nichiren Shoshu priests: idle behavior, lack of missionary commitment, and extravagant lifestyles. Second president Josei Toda had previously warned against priests prioritizing status and wealth over spiritual work.

Vow 62

On January 3, 1991, the Soka Gakkai presented three requests to Nichiren Shoshu: adopting democratic values, respecting lay believers as equals rather than subordinates, and addressing clerical corruption. Shin'ichi Yamamoto encouraged members to pursue these reforms while maintaining steadfast faith.

That month, Yamamoto issued a peace proposal addressing the Gulf War, calling for UN-led resolution. The SGI Asia Council adopted an urgent appeal supporting these peace initiatives, demonstrating how faith motivates commitment to global harmony.

Vow 63

Yamamoto continued extensive travel promoting cultural and educational exchange. He visited the University of East Asia in Macau, delivered lectures in the Philippines and Harvard University, and toured Japanese regions encouraging members.

Meanwhile, Nichiren Shoshu announced policy changes ending official recognition of overseas lay organizations and restricting pilgrimages to their head temple. This represented a dramatic reversal after decades of Soka Gakkai support.

Vow 64

The Soka Gakkai had substantially invested in Taiseki-ji temple development. During Toda's presidency and Yamamoto's tenure, they donated multiple buildings and facilities. Over four decades, members made approximately 70 million pilgrimages, generating crucial financial support that helped the temple recover from postwar agricultural reforms.

In July 1991, Nichiren Shoshu mandated that lay believers register as temple parishioners, explicitly attempting to force Soka Gakkai members to abandon their organization. This represented one of Buddhism's gravest transgressions: "causing disunity and disorder in the community of believers."

Vow 65

Yamamoto maintained his global engagement schedule while navigating organizational challenges. He lectured on "soft power," promoted cultural exchange, and met international leaders. Through these efforts and personal member engagement, he built mentor-disciple bonds strengthened by shared commitment to kosen-rufu.

As priesthood conflicts intensified, members developed clearer understanding of their mission, recognizing that attacks validated their Buddhist practice according to Nichiren's own teachings about persecution.

Vow 66

Yamamoto consistently returned to foundational Buddhist principles during member meetings. He referenced Charlie Chaplin's courage and Victor Hugo's advocacy for justice, connecting these to Nichiren's humanistic vision. He emphasized that attacks on the Soka Gakkai matched patterns described in Daishonin's writings, validating their mission.

Satellite video broadcasts beginning in 1989 unified the nationwide membership, allowing members to witness Yamamoto's commitment and deepen their understanding of doctrinal issues through direct dialogue.

Vow 67

On November 8, 1991, Nichiren Shoshu issued a "Remonstrance to the Soka Gakkai to Disband," claiming lay believers must revere priests as teachers. However, the Soka Gakkai had established legal independence in 1952, so Nichiren Shoshu possessed no authority to compel dissolution.

Members recognized the priesthood's hypocrisy. In September 1991, it emerged that High Priest Nikken had conducted ceremonies at a Zen temple cemetery—an act contradicting his accusations against the Soka Gakkai.

Vow 68

Soka Gakkai leaders held a press conference rejecting Nichiren Shoshu's demands, detailing the priesthood's authoritarianism and intolerance. Members began collecting petition signatures calling for Nikken's resignation.

The situation paralleled medieval European clerical corruption, where funeral rites and memorial practices were exploited financially. Members increasingly questioned whether such practices aligned with genuine Buddhism.

Vow 69

The Soka Gakkai reexamined funeral practices through Nichiren's original teachings. The Daishonin states that practitioners attain Buddhahood through their lifetime faith and chanting, requiring no priestly intermediation. Posthumous Buddhist names originated centuries after Nichiren's era and carry no doctrinal significance regarding Buddhahood attainment.

The Soka Gakkai developed lay-conducted funerals reflecting this understanding. Observers praised these ceremonies as "inspiring and buoyant," noting they conveyed "hope toward the deceased's departure," embodying positive Buddhist perspectives on life and death.

Vow 70

Scholars described Soka Gakkai lay funerals as "a revolutionary change in Japanese funeral practices," noting their progressive nature might face resistance but represented "the funerals of the future."

The Heisei Reformation emerged as members championed humanistic Nichiren Buddhism principles. Nearly 5 million petition signatures demanding Nikken's resignation were collected within ten days. Members recognized the appearance of the "third powerful enemy"—corrupt high priests—as validation that they were practicing authentic Lotus Sutra Buddhism as Nichiren predicted.

This section documents pivotal events in Soka Gakkai history during late 1991 and early 1992, focusing on the organization's separation from Nichiren Shoshu and its emergence as an independent religious movement.

Key Events

The Excommunication, November 1991

Nichiren Shoshu issued a formal excommunication notice against the Soka Gakkai after the lay organization refused compliance with previous demands. The priesthood simultaneously excommunicated all SGI organizations worldwide.

Senior Soka Gakkai leaders, including Hiroshi Izumida, responded by exposing the priesthood's corruption and authoritarian practices. Izumida criticized Nichiren Shoshu's historical compromises, stating that "they accepted the Shinto talisman" and manipulated believers by withholding religious objects.

International Recognition

On the same day the excommunication arrived, the Association of African Heads of Mission honored SGI President Shin'ichi Yamamoto with a Certificate of Appreciation for his contributions to "world peace through education, culture" and human rights advocacy.

Leadership Response

Soka Gakkai President Eisuke Akizuki declared that "Nichiren Shoshu...has degenerated into the 'Nikken sect'" and proclaimed the organization's "spiritual independence." Members responded with jubilation, recognizing November 28 as a historic date marking their autonomous path forward.

Institutional Developments

The organization established ceremonies divisions throughout Japan and presented a petition bearing over 16 million signatures calling for High Priest Nikken's resignation.

Members celebrated with cultural festivals and music performances throughout late 1991, advancing toward the 21st century with renewed commitment to global propagation of Buddhist teachings.

Vow 81

Shin'ichi Yamamoto returned to Japan after visiting India, Thailand, and Hong Kong. The 1st SGI Asia General Meeting convened in Okinawa from February 25 through 27, with representatives from across Asia attending.

At a gongyo session, Shin'ichi announced plans to establish a Soka Bodhi Tree Garden in New Delhi. He emphasized that Buddhist practice should bring joy rather than burden, stating: "Our Buddhist practice is not an obligation; it is our greatest privilege."

Vow 82

The final day of the Asia General Meeting included a peace music festival featuring performances by SGI members from Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Singapore in traditional dress. Young performers—mostly born in 1972 when Okinawa returned to Japan—sang and danced with vibrant energy.

Members adopted the "Asia Declaration," committing to three points: respecting national cultures while demonstrating faith in daily life; engaging in international cultural and educational exchange; and supporting UN-centered peace efforts.

Vow 83

Speaking to Okinawa leaders, Shin'ichi stressed the importance of nurturing young members through shared activities and by giving them leadership opportunities. He noted: "Truly great leaders are those who steadily foster youth to be even more capable than they themselves are."

He announced plans to build a training center in the Philippines and establish Soka kindergartens in Singapore and Hong Kong, describing the SGI Asia meeting as marking "the start of an age of great exchange" in philosophy, culture, and peace heading into the 21st century.

Vow 84

Okinawa embodies two key principles: "Nuchi du takara," meaning Life is a treasure, and "Ichariba chode," meaning Once we meet, we are brothers and sisters. Despite suffering tremendous losses during World War II, Okinawans maintained their spirit of respect for life.

Shin'ichi felt called to transform Okinawa's destiny through Buddhist humanistic ideals. He began writing The Human Revolution in Okinawa in 1964, opening with: "Nothing is more barbarous than war. Nothing is more cruel."

Vow 85

The Soka Gakkai opened the Okinawa Training Center in 1977 on a former U.S. missile launch site. Rather than removing it, Shin'ichi suggested keeping it as "a historical reminder of humanity's foolish obsession with war."

The missile complex was transformed into the World Peace Monument, topped with six youth statues facing the future. The grounds now feature over a hundred plant varieties, symbolizing the conversion of a weapons site into a center for peace and kosen-rufu.

Vow 86

Addressing members at the training center via satellite broadcast, Shin'ichi declared: "Our Soka family will always advance in solidarity based on sincerity, equality, and trust, transcending national boundaries."

He emphasized that the Soka Gakkai must win its struggles, as "winning is the only way to protect our members and defend what is right." Members in Oita Prefecture had remained resolute despite recent priesthood conflicts.

Vow 87

With the Soka Gakkai now independent from Nichiren Shoshu, Shin'ichi intensified global efforts to build foundations for worldwide kosen-rufu by the year 2000. From June through July 1992, he visited Germany, Egypt, Turkey, and other nations.

In Frankfurt, he addressed SGI members from 13 Central and Eastern European countries plus Russia. He recalled how Josei Toda had grieved for Hungarian suffering during the 1956 revolution and encouraged the emerging Bodhisattvas of the Earth in that region.

Vow 88

In October 1992, Shin'ichi made his eighth visit to China, where the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences presented him with the title of Honorary Research Professor—a first for the institution.

In early 1993, he traveled to the United States and South America. At Claremont McKenna College, he discussed new principles of integration and the bodhisattva and Buddhahood states in Nichiren Buddhism. Nobel laureate Linus Pauling affirmed that "the bodhisattva spirit presented by Shin'ichi...was vital for the happiness of humanity."

Vow 89

Shin'ichi met with civil rights icon Rosa Parks at Soka University's Los Angeles campus. Parks later included a photograph of their meeting in the book Talking Pictures, writing that it represented "the most impactful event of my life" and an opportunity to work for world peace together.

Visiting the Museum of Tolerance, Shin'ichi confronted exhibits on the Holocaust and other atrocities. He expressed profound outrage and determination: "such a tragedy must never be allowed to occur again, at any time or in any place."

Vow 90

On February 6, 1993, Shin'ichi traveled to Colombia at President Cesar Gaviria Trujillo's invitation, despite recent drug cartel bombings and declared emergency. When asked if he would still visit, Shin'ichi replied without hesitation that he would keep his commitment, behaving "as a citizen of Colombia, whose people are so incredibly courageous."

On February 7, an SGI chapter was established in Colombia. The following day, Shin'ichi met with President Gaviria and presented him with a composed poem praising the young leader's courage and expressing hopes for Colombia's bright future.

Vow 91

Shin'ichi Yamamoto received Colombia's Order of San Carlos and a medal from the Colombian Institute of Culture. He then traveled to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where he was met by 94-year-old Austregésilo de Athayde, president of the Brazilian Academy of Letters. Athayde had fought against dictatorship, contributed to drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights after World War II, and had long wished to meet Yamamoto after learning of his philosophy through friends and SGI members.

Vow 92

Upon arrival, Yamamoto and Athayde embraced warmly. Athayde called Yamamoto "one of the defining figures of this century" and urged him to work together to change human history. Yamamoto responded by honoring Athayde as a comrade and friend. At an SGI-Brazil conference, Yamamoto cited his mentor Josei Toda's teaching that Buddhism requires active effort and wisdom, not passive faith alone.

Vow 93

Yamamoto emphasized Toda's instruction that understanding worldly affairs requires continuous study and improvement. He stressed that Buddhist practitioners must "summon powerful wisdom" through practice to overcome difficulties. On February 11, the final installment of Yamamoto's 12-volume novel The Human Revolution was published, concluding his nearly 28-year serialization dedicated to his mentor.

Vow 94

Yamamoto received an honorary doctorate from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. He spoke about Toda's philosophy that all people possess supreme treasures within themselves and that compassionate commitment generates limitless wisdom. He met with Athayde again and agreed to collaborate on a dialogue about human rights in the twenty-first century.

Vow 95

Athayde expressed deep admiration for Yamamoto, saying this was the first time in his nearly 100 years he had wanted to meet someone as much. He called Yamamoto "a person who is changing the history of humankind." Their spirits resonated as they discussed using "noble words as our supreme weapon" to advance human rights and usher in a new age.

Vow 96

Yamamoto became the first Japanese and first Asian appointed as a foreign associate member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters, joining distinguished figures like Tolstoy and Zola. He received the Machado de Assis Medal, the academy's highest honor. In his lecture, he argued that spiritually-grounded religion would form the backbone of global civilization in the twenty-first century.

Vow 97

Yamamoto traveled to Argentina on February 14. Athayde continued their dialogue through correspondence despite illness, recording responses about human rights before his death on September 13, 1993, just before turning 95. Their dialogue was later published as Human Rights in the Twenty-First Century. In Argentina, Yamamoto met with former presidential secretary Alberto Kohan and attended an SGI conference with youth preparing for an international peace culture festival.

Vow 98

Speaking to Argentine members, Yamamoto emphasized that Nichiren Buddhism teaches equality and encompasses all people across time and geography. He introduced Argentine poet Almafuerte's saying: "Sometimes a great destiny sleeps to be awakened by anguish." Yamamoto taught that suffering becomes a springboard to enlightenment when people actively overcome challenges with wisdom and determination.

Vow 99

Yamamoto met with Argentine President Carlos Menem and emphasized the importance of global unity and cultural flourishing in the twenty-first century. Young Argentine women of Japanese descent, educated at national and Japanese universities on government scholarships, served as official SGI interpreters. Their childhood participation in Soka Gakkai activities had inspired lifelong dedication to spreading the organization's mission.

Vow 100

The Argentine Senate and Chamber of Deputies honored Yamamoto for his peace efforts. A legislative bill based partly on Yamamoto's 1983 peace proposal had established a "Peace Day" and mandated peace education in schools. Senate leaders acknowledged his insight that "peace is not simply the absence of war" but requires respecting human dignity. Yamamoto received honorary degrees and honorary professorships, while ten cities presented him with keys or plaques.

Vow 101

On February 18, 1993, Buenos Aires hosted the 11th World Youth Peace Culture Festival at the Coliseo Theater with 1,500 youth participants. The event, themed "Melody of Hope in the Land of Ethnic Harmony," attracted prominent Argentine leaders including former president Arturo Frondizi and university presidents. Representatives from ten Central and South American nations attended.

The festival featured performances including flag parades, musical ensembles, and dance performances. The highlight was a joint performance by legendary tango masters Osvaldo Pugliese and Mariano Mores—particularly significant because Pugliese had reportedly retired from public performance in 1989.

Vow 102

Mariano Mores had offered to perform as a birthday gift, declining his own celebration to participate. He and Shin'ichi Yamamoto had first met in 1988 during a Min-On Concert Association tour. Mores later presented Yamamoto with a musical composition titled "Ahora," meaning Now.

Osvaldo Pugliese arrived via his farewell tour in 1989 and composed "Tokio Luminoso," meaning Shining Tokyo, for Yamamoto, adding the subtitle "Ode to Friendship." Both artists demonstrated personal commitment to the event and the SGI's peace mission.

Vow 103

The festival succeeded brilliantly, moving Yamamoto to compose commemorative poetry. The following day, February 19, the first SGI-Argentina General Meeting convened with 2,500 members plus attendees from three other Latin American countries and Spain.

Yamamoto received an honorary doctorate from Argentina's National University of Cordoba. Rector Francisco Delich noted that Yamamoto had demonstrated that "countries of Asia and the West" could achieve harmony and that "the human race can overcome conflict" arising from cultural differences.

Vow 104

On February 20, Yamamoto traveled to Paraguay, his first visit to that nation. The mayor of Asuncion welcomed him at the airport with an official plaque.

At the first SGI-Paraguay General Meeting on February 21, attended by 700 members, Yamamoto encouraged the children present and acknowledged the pioneering efforts of Japanese immigrants who had faced severe hardships establishing the movement there. The Paraguayan government recognized the visit with special postal markings acknowledging the SGI's UN-registered NGO status and peace advocacy.

Vow 105

Yamamoto emphasized that "one person standing up earnestly" could bring happiness to those around them and transform their environment. He stressed that numerical strength matters less than sincere commitment to practice.

Advising members about children's religious education, he noted that faith must ultimately be chosen freely by young people, while parents should exemplify the benefits through their own practice. The Friendship Evening featured traditional performances including the bottle dance and a specially composed classical guitar piece titled "Fantasia Japonesa."

Vow 106

Yamamoto had planned to visit Brazil in 1974 but was denied a visa due to prejudice against the Soka Gakkai. When he finally visited in 1984, SGI-Paraguay members who had traveled there sang traditional songs expressing their determination to open new pathways for the movement.

Ten years later, at the Paraguay gathering, Yamamoto encouraged youth to "surpass" him and carry forward the pioneering legacy, promising that their efforts would transform kosen-rufu into "a mightily flowing river."

Vow 107

After meeting President Andres Rodriguez on February 22, Yamamoto attended a National Order of Merit ceremony at Paraguay's Foreign Ministry. The foreign minister praised his peace efforts, noting that dialogue could "eliminate discrimination and realize lasting peace."

Later that day, Yamamoto received an honorary doctorate from the National University of Asuncion's Faculty of Philosophy. Before departing for Chile on February 23, he gifted the members a poem referencing Paraguay's rivers and landscape as reflecting "a Buddha land."

Vow 108

Chile would be the 50th country Yamamoto had visited. His global journeys had begun in October 1960, five months after becoming the third Soka Gakkai president in May 1960.

Josei Toda, his mentor, had urged him with his final strength: "The world is your true stage. You must live as long as you can, and travel the globe!" Though Toda never traveled outside Japan, he dreamed of Mexico and instilled in Yamamoto the vision of worldwide kosen-rufu.

Vow 109

Chile's SGI members had endured severe trials. During the 1973 military coup in Santiago, machine-gun fire riddled the leadership couple's home, though they remained safe where the Gohonzon was enshrined.

For years afterward, assemblies were banned; members held informal discussions at homes while authorities observed their meetings. Members drew strength from knowing Yamamoto was aware of their struggles and sent encouragement. Democracy only returned to Chile three years before his visit, allowing free assembly.

Vow 110

At the first SGI-Chile General Meeting, Yamamoto praised members for remaining "undefeated by adversity" and assured them of accumulating "benefit as boundless as the vast expanse of the Andes."

Reflecting on his 33-year journey that began gazing at Mount Fuji, Yamamoto noted that Chile's Mount Osorno represented the opposite side of the earth. He cited the Daishonin's teaching emphasizing the importance of wisdom and prudent conduct, stressing that Nichiren Buddhism is "a tolerant, engaged religion" requiring cordial relations and mutual respect both within and beyond the organization.

This concluding section documents Shin'ichi Yamamoto's continued global travels and leadership from 1993 through 2001, culminating in the establishment of Soka University of America and his response to the September 11 terrorist attacks.

Key themes include:

First, Yamamoto's meetings with world leaders continued, including Chilean President Patricio Aylwin, who later visited Japan and lectured at Soka University. Their three meetings formed the basis for a published dialogue collection.

Second, humanitarian awards and recognitions accumulated as Yamamoto traveled to Miami, San Francisco, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Canada, Russia, and Europe, devoting himself to building foundations for global peace efforts.

Third, the 1995 Great Hanshin Earthquake killed approximately 6,400 people. Yamamoto immediately mobilized Soka Gakkai resources for rescue and relief efforts, with facilities becoming evacuation and relief centers. Members formed motorcycle corps to deliver emergency supplies through debris-blocked streets.

Fourth, Yamamoto delivered a lecture at the East-West Center titled "Peace and Human Security: A Buddhist Perspective for the Twenty-first Century," arguing that peace requires human revolution—inner transformation—rather than focusing solely on institutional reform.

Fifth, in Nepal, Yamamoto met with King Birendra and received an honorary Doctor of Letters degree from Tribhuvan University after delivering a commencement address titled "Homage to the Sagarmatha of Humanism."

Sixth, the SGI Charter was drafted in 1995, clarifying the organization's aims with ten articles committed to peace, culture, education, human rights, environmental protection, and character cultivation.

Seventh, Yamamoto visited Cuba in June 1996 despite U.S. sanctions, receiving the Order of Felix Varela and an honorary doctorate from the University of Havana. He met President Fidel Castro for 90 minutes, discussing leadership, education, and dialogue's importance for 21st-century peace.

Eighth, between 1997 and 2000, Yamamoto made multiple trips throughout Asia—Hong Kong, China, India, the Philippines, and South Korea—traveling almost continuously.

Ninth, in 2001, designated the "Year of Total Victory for the New Century," Soka University of America launched in California. Following the September 11 terrorist attacks, Yamamoto called for dialogue and interfaith cooperation, stating that terrorism is "absolutely unacceptable" regardless of perceived justifications.

Finally, speaking to youth division members, Yamamoto expressed determination to pass the mentor-disciple mission to the next generation, stating: "The development of kosen-rufu depends on the existence of genuine disciples!" He envisioned youth as "Bodhisattvas of the Earth" advancing the organization's global peace mission.

This concludes Volume 30 of The New Human Revolution and the final volume of the series.
