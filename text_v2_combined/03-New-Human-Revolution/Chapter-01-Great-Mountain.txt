Volume 30: Chapter 1, Great Mountain 1 through 10

Great Mountain 1

Nichiren Daishonin emphasized that disciples should dedicate themselves to propagating the Lotus Sutra. The Soka Gakkai members work toward worldwide kosen-rufu—the spread of Buddhism globally—by bringing happiness to those around them through genuine human connection.

Shin'ichi Yamamoto and a Soka Gakkai delegation departed India on February 16, 1979, arriving in Hong Kong to conclude his final overseas trip before the Seven Bells concluded on May 3, 1979. During his visit, he focused on building educational and cultural bridges between Soka University and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, believing such exchanges were essential for 21st-century world peace.

Great Mountain 2

A Southeast Asia representatives conference gathered 65 members from nine countries and two territories on February 18. These pioneers had overcome tremendous obstacles and language barriers to establish Buddhism in their regions despite deep anti-Japanese sentiment following World War II. Their commitment represented the essence of kosen-rufu—expanding happiness through individual dedication and dialogue, one person at a time.

Great Mountain 3

Shin'ichi addressed the leaders about essential qualities for advancing kosen-rufu. He emphasized that "all our members possess the respectworthy life state of Buddhahood" and reminded them that while organizational roles exist, all people remain fundamentally equal. He urged them to avoid personal profit-seeking, keep member happiness as the primary goal, and maintain democratic, harmonious governance.

Great Mountain 4

Shin'ichi stressed the importance of unity grounded in faith rather than emotion. He called leaders to develop "big hearts," becoming pillars of spiritual support in their societies. He acknowledged inevitable obstacles—opposition, betrayal, internal conflict—but encouraged them to view adversity as opportunity for spiritual growth and expanded kosen-rufu.

Great Mountain 5

On February 19, Shin'ichi met with Hong Kong's Governor Sir Murray MacLehose. Their discussion centered on educational exchange enabling young people to "forge friendships, freely exchange their thoughts on the world's future" across national and cultural boundaries. That afternoon, 556 members performed at a culture festival celebrating human harmony and peace aspirations for Asia.

Great Mountain 6

The festival finale symbolized genuine unity, with performers of diverse backgrounds—Chinese, British, Japanese—singing together in solidarity. In eighteen years, the Hong Kong membership had grown substantially, enabling such large-scale cultural expression. Shin'ichi reflected that "building world peace is our mission" but stressed it emerges through expanding "circles of friendship and trust" within communities.

Great Mountain 7

Returning to Japan on February 20, Shin'ichi intensified his activities, writing articles, encouraging members, and conducting guidance tours across multiple prefectures. Meanwhile, Nichiren Shoshu priests renewed attacks on the Soka Gakkai despite previous agreements about priesthood-laity harmony. The organization faced renewed scrutiny and criticism from institutional religious authorities.

Great Mountain 8

By early 1979, tensions escalated when Vice President Genji Samejima made controversial statements at a March 6 meeting in Fukuoka, claiming the priesthood operated from "jealousy" and describing the head temple dismissively. The priesthood seized on these remarks as evidence the Soka Gakkai lacked sincerity, sending formal letters of inquiry and protest to organizational leadership.

Great Mountain 9

As Soka Gakkai president, Shin'ichi became the primary target of priestly complaints. The Hokkeko Federation formally called for his removal as chief representative of Nichiren Shoshu lay organizations. Demands for his resignation intensified from both priests and former members who had become critics. The organization faced its most serious institutional challenge yet.

Great Mountain 10

During memorial services commemorating Josei Toda's death on April 2, Shin'ichi renewed his commitment to his mentor's vision. Reflecting on the priesthood's persistent attacks despite the Gakkai's efforts at reconciliation, he recognized a fundamental philosophical divide: Nichiren Shoshu maintained hierarchical priest-superiority traditions, while "Nichiren Buddhism is a teaching of equality that demolishes discriminatory barriers."

Volume 30: Chapter 1, Great Mountain 11 through 20

Great Mountain 11

Nichiren Daishonin taught that all people possess Buddha nature equally and can attain enlightenment through the Mystic Law, establishing a life of absolute happiness. This universal teaching emphasizes human equality and respect for life's dignity.

Shin'ichi sensed dangerous deception behind the priests' domineering behavior toward lay believers. During World War II, when Japan's militarist government enforced thought control, Nichiren Shoshu accepted Shinto talismans. However, the Soka Gakkai's first two presidents—Tsunesaburo Makiguchi and Josei Toda—upheld correct teachings and were imprisoned. Makiguchi died in prison for his beliefs, yet the priesthood subsequently harassed the Soka Gakkai despite the organization's postwar support.

According to Buddhist teaching, "neither non-Buddhists nor the enemies of Buddhism can destroy the correct teaching of the Thus Come One, but the Buddha's disciples definitely can." The Lotus Sutra describes how devil forces possess priests who then create confusion among believers. Shin'ichi recalled his mentor's warning: "Kosen-rufu will never advance without the Soka Gakkai."

Great Mountain 12

Shin'ichi prioritized stopping the priests' attacks and protecting members. He had witnessed suffering members across the country subjected to abusive priest behavior. Vice President Genji Samejima's irresponsible statements had nullified all the Soka Gakkai's efforts toward reconciliation.

Determined to protect his members, Shin'ichi considered the Soka Gakkai more precious than anything else—a principle Toda had emphasized throughout his leadership. The organization had become Japan's "king of the religious world" and a force for peace, with members emerging as outstanding individuals across society. Through Buddhist study emphasizing practical daily relevance, members established Nichiren Buddhism as their guiding philosophy.

Entering 1979—when the Seven Bells would conclude—the Soka Gakkai enjoyed unprecedented development and global expansion.

Great Mountain 13

Shin'ichi had long considered stepping down as president to develop successors and ensure the eternal transmission of the Mystic Law. In 1970, after leading for over a decade, he informed executives of his intention to step down, but they insisted the presidency was a lifelong appointment.

In 1974, he relinquished his representative director position to the general director. In 1977, he again raised the presidency succession issue, but executives opposed him.

Now, approaching the 19th anniversary of his inauguration, Shin'ichi reconsidered passing the presidency when appropriate. At 51 and in good health, he could support members afterward. However, significant work remained for world peace and kosen-rufu development globally.

Though the Soka Gakkai enjoyed unprecedented growth, dark clouds loomed with stormy winds blowing. Challenging trials would be inevitable. Leaders succeeding him would need clear faith to recognize devilish forces and determine to overcome them.

Great Mountain 14

On April 3, Shin'ichi addressed Seikyo Shimbun distributors, emphasizing health care for their important mission. He stressed that neglecting basics in faith and daily life indicates carelessness and arrogance. Those desiring fame and fortune while avoiding genuine effort ultimately stumble, unable to escape the Buddhist law of cause and effect.

He encouraged sincere, serious attention to each challenge, noting that though distribution work is hard and often unrecognized, the Seikyo Shimbun's availability and kosen-rufu's advancement depend on their efforts. Shin'ichi assured them: "I am chanting for your well-being and safety every day."

Great Mountain 15

On April 4 evening, attorney Tomomasa Yamawaki, serving as priesthood liaison, called youth division leader Isamu Nomura with urgent news. Meeting with Nomura and General Director Kiyoshi Jujo, Yamawaki warned that Vice President Samejima's statements had provoked the priesthood to plan an all-out attack.

Yamawaki stated: "President Yamamoto will most likely have to resign, not only as the head of all Nichiren Shoshu lay organizations but also as Soka Gakkai president." The words "prepared for the worst" pierced Jujo's heart.

On April 5 morning, Shin'ichi attended an emergency executive conference at the Tachikawa Culture Center. Shin'ichi recognized this as a devilish plot to force his resignation and drive wedges between him and members. He understood the crucial importance of seeing through devilish functions with faith's eyes.

Great Mountain 16

Shin'ichi looked intently at the leaders' troubled expressions. When prompted for opinions, one finally murmured that "you can't go against the flow of the times."

A sharp pain struck Shin'ichi's heart—this cowardice distressed him deeply. While prepared to bow apologetically to the priesthood if necessary, he found it pitiful that leaders now viewed circumstances as "the flow of the times."

Breaking the silence sternly, Shin'ichi declared: "All right, I will resign as the head of all Nichiren Shoshu lay organizations and as Soka Gakkai president." However, he emphasized the critical point: "But it must be the Soka Gakkai, not the priesthood, that decides when its president steps down."

He believed that allowing priesthood pressure to force a president's resignation would create a dangerous precedent and eternally blemish the priesthood's history. The Soka Gakkai, through sincere support, had saved the priesthood from postwar ruin and alone was advancing kosen-rufu with selfless dedication, spreading the Mystic Law worldwide.

Great Mountain 17

Josei Toda had instructed disciples to protect the third president throughout their lives, ensuring kosen-rufu's achievement. Shin'ichi was shocked that leaders had forgotten this spirit their mentor taught for kosen-rufu's sake.

Addressing the leaders with a prayer in his heart, Shin'ichi declared: "I am a lion! I'm not afraid of anything. You need to be lions, too! Otherwise, the members will suffer." He urged them to walk the great path of mentor and disciple with dauntless courage and strong fighting spirit, assuring them that with such commitment, nothing could shake the Soka Gakkai. "President Toda is watching!" he concluded.

Standing and leaving, Shin'ichi gazed at cherry blossoms dancing in the breeze, reflecting on the momentous struggles waged by Makiguchi and Toda as mentor and disciple.

Great Mountain 18

Shin'ichi recalled the April 1952 incident during the head temple's 700th anniversary festivities. Youth division members discovered Jiko Kasahara, supposedly expelled by the priesthood, at the head temple. During World War II, Kasahara had opportunistically espoused the erroneous doctrine that Buddhism is subordinate to Shinto, betraying the Daishonin's teachings and triggering government oppression that led to Makiguchi's imprisonment death.

Youth members pressed Kasahara at Makiguchi's grave to admit his doctrine's error. The priesthood reacted by convening the Nichiren Shoshu Council, which called Toda's actions "a disgraceful incident unprecedented since the head temple's founding" and demanded his apology, dismissal, and temple banishment.

Shin'ichi and other Toda disciples rose to defend him, meeting council members individually to explain events and request resolution revocation. Inside, Shin'ichi burned with outrage, thinking that the priesthood sought to drive a wedge between Toda and members by isolating the president.

Great Mountain 19

Hearing sincere explanations from Shin'ichi and Toda's other disciples, many council members changed their minds and agreed with revoking the disciplinary resolution. High Priest Nissho Mizutani did not act on it.

Overcoming the Kasahara Incident strengthened mentor-disciple unity in the Soka Gakkai, propelling it forward toward Toda's goal of 750,000 member households.

Returning to present circumstances, Shin'ichi was deeply concerned that top leaders lacked the resolute mentor-disciple spirit and passionate fighting spirit for kosen-rufu that had characterized Toda's era.

On April 6, Shin'ichi went to the head temple for the annual Scroll-Airing Ceremony, where he informed High Priest Nittatsu of his intention to resign as both head of Nichiren Shoshu lay organizations and Soka Gakkai president.

Shin'ichi's priority was protecting members from self-serving priests. Even stepping down, he felt confident that younger members would carry the torch toward the 21st century.

Great Mountain 20

On April 7 afternoon, Shin'ichi welcomed a 20-member All-China Youth Federation delegation near the Zhou Cherry Tree on the Soka University campus in Hachioji, Tokyo.

Shin'ichi explained the tree's origins to delegation leader Gao Zhanxiang: "This cherry tree was planted on November 2, 1975, with prayers for Premier Zhou Enlai's health and wishes for lasting peace between our countries." Chinese students studying at Soka University performed the actual planting.

Shin'ichi recounted meeting Premier Zhou in December 1974 at a Beijing hospital. Despite his illness, Zhou expressed earnest wishes for friendly China-Japan relations and world peace, nostalgically reflecting that he had departed Japan during cherry blossom season. When Shin'ichi urged him to return and see the blossoms again, Zhou sadly replied it would probably be impossible.

After Zhou's January 1976 death, Shin'ichi vowed to devote himself entirely to the friendship Zhou cherished and ensure it endured forever. Shin'ichi prepared to plant two additional cherry trees honoring both Premier Zhou and his wife, Deng Yingchao, as a shared vow for everlasting friendship.

Volume 30: Chapter 1, Great Mountain 21 through 30

Great Mountain 21

Shin'ichi led the All-China Youth Federation delegation to a cherry tree planting ceremony near Soka University. Two trees were dedicated to Zhou Enlai and his wife Deng Yingchao. Delegation leader Gao Zhanxiang expressed deep emotion, reciting a poem about the sincerity and friendship represented by the trees. He later composed additional verse celebrating the enduring flower of friendship between the neighboring nations.

Great Mountain 22

Shin'ichi maintained lasting friendship with Gao Zhanxiang, who became vice minister of culture. In 1992, on the 20th anniversary of China-Japan diplomatic relations, Gao presented Shin'ichi with a cultural exchange award and a calligraphy expressing their connection across waters. Gao subsequently held numerous leadership positions and authored books on culture. Between 2010 and 2012, they collaborated on a dialogue about culture's unifying power for peace.

Great Mountain 23

Shin'ichi addressed Soka University's 9th entrance ceremony on April 9, emphasizing humble learning and individual worth. He quoted philosopher Georg Simmel on the difference between pride in one's inherent value and vanity based on social comparison. Later that day, he warmly welcomed the third group of Chinese students to the university's Japanese language institute.

Great Mountain 24

Shin'ichi encouraged the Chinese students, noting that "the future of China and Japan rests on your shoulders." Japanese and Chinese students sang together, with their united voices symbolizing future peace. Shin'ichi envisioned this moment as representing the beacon of hope guiding toward global peace.

Great Mountain 25

Deng Yingchao, widow of Premier Zhou Enlai, arrived in Japan on April 8 as head of a National People's Congress delegation. Shin'ichi met her on April 12 at the State Guesthouse, where he presented cherry blossoms she had wished to see, along with an album of photographs documenting tree plantings and Chinese students at Soka University.

Great Mountain 26

Shin'ichi showed Deng Yingchao photographs documenting the memorial trees and Chinese international students. They discussed a proposed exhibition about Premier Zhou's achievements and China's Four Modernizations initiative. Their cordial conversation lasted approximately 40 minutes.

Great Mountain 27

When Shin'ichi mentioned his intention to resign as Soka Gakkai president, Deng Yingchao responded firmly: "You must not retreat a single step!" Her words, spoken with the authority of a leader who had devoted her life to building the People's Republic, deeply moved him. Shin'ichi renewed his determination to work for lasting China-Japan friendship regardless of position.

Following her counsel, Shin'ichi visited China in April 1980, where Deng Yingchao hosted him and his wife Mineko at her residence in Beijing's Zhongnanhai area. He returned again in June 1984 and remained committed to China-Japan exchange even after the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident, when many nations isolated China.

Great Mountain 28

In May 1990, despite international tensions following Tiananmen Square, Shin'ichi organized delegations totaling 281 Japanese members to visit China, helping reopen exchange when other groups hesitated. He and Mineko visited Deng Yingchao at her Zhongnanhai residence, where the 86-year-old, despite health challenges, presented him with Premier Zhou's ivory paper knife and her jade pen holder—gifts she considered national treasures and symbols of eternal peace and friendship.

Great Mountain 29

On April 13, Shin'ichi met with Konosuke Matsushita, founder of Matsushita Electric, to discuss his resignation as Soka Gakkai president. Matsushita observed that "the most admirable life is one where you can be proud of yourself and give yourself a pat on the back." That evening, Shin'ichi traveled to the newly completed Kanagawa Culture Center in Yokohama, reflecting that this location held significance as where his mentor Josei Toda had declared for nuclear weapons abolition in 1957.

Great Mountain 30

On April 14, Shin'ichi attended opening celebrations for the Kanagawa Culture Center. He reminisced about his first discussion meeting in Yokohama 30 years earlier, where five guests became members. He emphasized that conviction in the Gohonzon and genuine concern for others' happiness constitute the most powerful force in propagation. He urged members to maintain unshakeable faith through coming turning points, returning always to what founder Makiguchi termed the "stand-alone spirit" of kosen-rufu.

Volume 30: Chapter 1, Great Mountain 31 through 40

Great Mountain 31

The Soka Gakkai represents assembled Bodhisattvas of the Earth working to realize kosen-rufu, the mission entrusted by Nichiren Daishonin to his followers. The organization's first two presidents—Tsunesaburo Makiguchi and Josei Toda—devoted themselves to spreading the Law and advancing human happiness. Their successors continue this legacy with commitment to spreading the Mystic Law.

On April 16, 1979, Shin'ichi Yamamoto met with former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger at the House of International Friendship in Tokyo. Though their last meeting occurred four years prior, they renewed their connection and discussed paths toward lasting peace. Kissinger, born in Germany in 1923, had escaped Nazi persecution and later became a prominent diplomat under President Richard Nixon, serving as national security advisor and secretary of state. His work included facilitating U.S.-China relations, arms limitation talks, Vietnam peace negotiations, and Middle East diplomacy. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1973 and subsequently taught at Georgetown University following Jimmy Carter's 1977 presidential inauguration.

Great Mountain 32

During their extended conversation, Kissinger shared details about his forthcoming memoir, focusing on diplomatic accomplishments rather than personal matters. Shin'ichi emphasized that "actual efforts and accomplishments are what matter most" in both diplomacy and personal development.

Their discussion ranged across numerous subjects, including influential figures in their lives, messages for youth, and contemporary global situations. When war threats arose as a topic, Shin'ichi stressed that peace-promoting philosophies and religions remain essential. Kissinger concurred completely.

Shin'ichi referenced King Ashoka's reign in India and Buddhism's role in establishing peaceful governance. He explained that Ashoka succeeded by basing his government on Buddhism's principle that all people possess Buddha nature—"the supreme and incomparable life state of Buddhahood." This teaching grounds respect for human dignity and equality, fostering philosophies valuing peace and humanism.

Recognizing they needed extensive time to explore their topics thoroughly, both agreed to meet again. This materialized in September 1986 through two consecutive days of dialogue, continued via correspondence, and serialized in the Soka Gakkai magazine Ushio from January through August 1987. That September, it was published as Heiwa to Jinsei to Tetsugaku wo Kataru, meaning Discussions on Peace, Life, and Philosophy.

Great Mountain 33

Shin'ichi resolved to communicate Buddhist philosophy centered on respecting life's dignity and universal human equality—principles suitable for guiding the twenty-first century toward peace. On April 20, marking the 28th anniversary of the Seikyo Shimbun, the Soka Gakkai's daily newspaper, he met with Indian Express Editor-in-Chief S. Mulgaokar at Kanagawa Culture Center, discussing peace promotion and journalism's role.

Focusing on global peace realization, Shin'ichi engaged leaders and thinkers worldwide while maintaining personal member encouragement through home visits and guidance. At Kanagawa Culture Center, he greeted and spoke with dozens of visiting members, offering words of encouragement.

He resolved to perpetually support fellow members and walk alongside ordinary, hardworking people regardless of circumstances or position. Personal encouragement efforts and world peace initiatives share identical foundations: the Buddhist teaching that all people are inherently Buddhas, inspiring compassionate practice grounded in this belief.

Speaking with youth division leader Takayoshi Oga and other young people, Shin'ichi declared: "The world is your stage! Make the most of this precious life and join me in the great adventure of worldwide kosen-rufu!"

Witnessing the young people's resolve and commitment, he felt boundless hope. Shin'ichi remained acutely conscious of worldwide suffering from war, famine, poverty, and other harsh realities. Deeply pondering how to end the Cold War dividing the world, he determined to continue dialogue with world leaders as a concerned citizen, recognizing this as the sole path toward building peace despite apparent impossibility.

Great Mountain 34

On April 22, Shin'ichi visited the Nichiren Shoshu head temple to meet High Priest Nittatsu. Mount Fuji stood majestically against the blue sky, snowcapped peak serene despite fierce winds—an inspiring, uplifting sight for Shin'ichi.

He had come viewing his resignation from heading all Nichiren Shoshu lay organizations and the Soka Gakkai presidency as positive for the organization's future. While his resignation aimed to protect members from unreasonable attacks by younger priests, he sensed the Seven Bells' completion heralded new dynamic growth and development. Additionally, unfinished projects requiring presidential time remained, including interfaith dialogue for peace and increased personal member encouragement, particularly visiting pioneer members at home.

Shin'ichi confirmed his resignation intention to High Priest Nittatsu, stating formal submission would occur April 26. Nittatsu responded by indicating he would subsequently appoint Shin'ichi as honorary head of all Nichiren Shoshu lay organizations.

Shin'ichi also announced plans to step down as Soka Gakkai president—held for nineteen years—coinciding with the Seven Bells' completion. He envisioned continuing to support members and pursue peace, culture, and education activities in his new role.

Since the Soka Gakkai dedicates itself to kosen-rufu and human happiness, it cannot permit progress to falter. Shin'ichi firmly resolved to begin fresh struggles in a new role while earnestly praying for the organization's continued development. He declared internally: "A way forward opens when there is one determined individual. My disciples, rise up as lions! The crucial moment is here at last!"

Great Mountain 35

On April 24, the Seikyo Shimbun published Shin'ichi's article "Thoughts on the Completion of the Seven Bells" on its front page, coordinated with organizational leadership.

As the Seven Bells concluded, Shin'ichi wished to express gratitude toward members who had shared hardships and joys while preparing them for the organization's fresh beginning.

He began: "Walking the great path of kosen-rufu since founding president Tsunesaburo Makiguchi, we have advanced with the Seven Bells—a series of seven seven-year milestones—as progress landmarks. We are now celebrating this culmination, ending on Soka Gakkai Day, May 3, 1979."

Shin'ichi then expressed profound respect for members devoted to compassionately spreading Nichiren Buddhism.

"Twenty-one years have passed since President Toda's death, and I have been honored to serve as Soka Gakkai president for nineteen years, writing history of shared struggles and victories alongside you.

"I would like to once again express humble gratitude to all of you, valiant champions of the Mystic Law, who have striven energetically for kosen-rufu while supporting me despite my shortcomings. Please be assured that invaluable work we have achieved together will become eternal treasure in your lives.

"We are an assembly of ordinary people in the Latter Day of the Law. We have achieved progress and experienced setbacks, but we have always weathered adversity's stormy seas, created rising tides of development, and directed efforts toward consolidating those tides to realize the Daishonin's ideal of 'establishing the correct teaching for the peace of the land' and universal happiness and peace."

Shin'ichi knew without doubt that the Soka Gakkai—dedicated members working tirelessly alongside him—had opened the path for kosen-rufu through selfless spreading of the Mystic Law. He firmly believed that Bodhisattvas of the Earth had assembled under the Soka Gakkai banner to actualize the Daishonin's mandate in the Latter Day of the Law.

Great Mountain 36

In his article, Shin'ichi shared his vision for humanity's future, noting that amid emerging survival threats, the Soka Gakkai's network of Bodhisattvas had expanded to more than ninety countries, with Nichiren Buddhism representing humanity's sole hope.

"We are still in very early stages of fostering peace and culture worldwide, but seeds have been sown and are beginning to sprout. The real work lies ahead, requiring us to view it as a grand vision we must accomplish as Nichiren Buddhism practitioners.

"Religion is the heart of both peace and culture, with underlying power transcending national boundaries. From ancient times, religion has given life to culture.

"Peace must be built in each person's heart's fortress. Once we have established certain foundations, we must turn history's current toward enduring culture and peace."

When religions confine themselves to religious boundaries while ignoring real-world challenges, they serve no purpose. Religion must positively change society. As Buddhists, our mission involves realizing human happiness and world peace—why Nichiren Daishonin called for "establishing the correct teaching for the peace of the land."

Leo Tolstoy wrote: "But, as always, religion remains the chief motivator and heart of human societies."

Shin'ichi continued: "We have made historic progress and now see kosen-rufu's towering mountain range in the distance. We have capable people working for kosen-rufu and steady streams of young people emerging for the twenty-first century. This is extremely reassuring. We have long awaited this moment. It is victory won through faith bonds bringing together people from all walks of life—a song of human triumph."

This represented Shin'ichi's personal victory declaration. The reality of kosen-rufu achieved by the Soka Gakkai through its members remains eternal and imperishable.

Great Mountain 37

Truly great accomplishments require continuous effort and future successors to continue the work.

Shin'ichi continued: "The important thing now, given that kosen-rufu is an unremitting, ongoing revolution, is how we pass the torch to the next generation. Completing one phase starts another. Each milestone must create even more magnificent historical pages.

"Day after day, month after month, I have pondered how best to develop our movement for opening a great path to the twenty-first century; securing peace and happiness for each of you; and ensuring your children carry on Nichiren Buddhism's correct teaching while your families flourish eternally. This has been my responsibility responding to contemporary challenges.

"Now our movement for substantive kosen-rufu realization has grown from a small stream into a mighty river, flowing powerfully into the vast ocean."

Shin'ichi then wrote that he keenly felt the need to stabilize and perpetuate that mighty river's flow. He concluded by calling for members to engrave the Daishonin's assurance that kosen-rufu would be achieved "as surely as an arrow aimed at the earth cannot miss the target" deep in their hearts, renewing their vow to exert themselves in faith, practice, and study—Nichiren Buddhism's basics.

Those reading Shin'ichi's article that morning felt his deep gratitude and fresh-start resolve, inspiring renewed personal determinations.

No one imagined his presidential resignation would be announced that very day.

In fact, members began joyfully. April 22's final round of nationwide local assembly elections had concluded, with April 23's vote counting showing the Soka Gakkai–backed Komei Party achieving major victory.

Great Mountain 38

At 10:00 a.m. on April 24, a Soka Gakkai prefecture leaders meeting convened at Shinjuku Culture Center, approximately ten minutes' walk from Soka Gakkai Headquarters and the Seikyo Shimbun building in Tokyo's Shinanomachi. Participants gathered from across the country looked happy and upbeat, buoyed by the Komei Party's recent election success.

Although Shin'ichi was absent, the emcee announced the meeting's start.

Soka Gakkai General Director Kiyoshi Jujo rose first to speak. The prefecture leaders meeting, preceding May 3 Soka Gakkai Day, was meant to mark organizational activities' fresh departure, but Jujo appeared grave and unsmiling.

He began discussing the Seven Bells' origins.

"At the May 3, 1958 Headquarters General Meeting, while everyone grieved President Toda's death, President Yamamoto shared the Seven Bells vision. Reaffirming President Toda's observation that approximately every seven years since founding, the Soka Gakkai reached major development milestones, he declared the time had come to ring the fifth bell—ushering in the fifth seven-year period.

"This helped us overcome grief and make fresh starts with bright future hopes, aiming for 1979—when the seventh bell would close.

"Now that series ends. President Yamamoto has already announced new development visions afterward. From 1980, we will advance kosen-rufu efforts while aiming for four five-year milestones through 2000, then begin new Seven Bells with the twenty-first century's start.

"Since his inauguration, President Yamamoto has greatly expanded kosen-rufu from a stream to a river, and a river to an ocean, implementing various changes responding to changing times. He created more democratic organizations ensuring membership will and needs inform leadership through discussion and consensus systems. In 1974, he transferred the Soka Gakkai's representative director post from the president to the general director."

Shin'ichi had worked building new organizational structures for the future. Only through appropriately responding to contemporary needs can we ensure the Soka Gakkai flourishes eternally.

Great Mountain 39

Looking toward the future, both society and Soka Gakkai membership were certain to grow increasingly diverse. Thus, Shin'ichi felt it was even more important than before to draw upon varied opinions and ideas, ensuring the organization operated through collective leadership based on discussion and consensus. He envisioned an organization where the president played pivotal roles while executive leadership worked closely together advancing the organization.

Furthermore, he had a vision of organizations where each member shared personal responsibility for its development—as if they themselves were president—uniting with fellow members for kosen-rufu activities.

General Director Jujo continued: "President Yamamoto has implemented various organizational measures facilitating presidential effectiveness even after he is no longer in that position.

"For a long time, he has told us: 'Things are fine while I'm here, but what happens to the Gakkai when I'm gone? I want to take steps now preparing for that eventuality. I cannot remain president forever. Soon, I will need to hand over the reins and support the next president.'

"He also said: 'You are only thinking short-term, but I am looking far ahead and taking necessary steps for the future.'

"Now, seeing the Seven Bells' completion as an important movement milestone, President Yamamoto is announcing his presidential resignation."

Everyone gasped. Some doubted their ears. Others looked at Jujo dumbfounded with tears in their eyes.

Jujo was also overcome emotionally, but rallied himself: "President Yamamoto said: 'For Soka Gakkai stability, continuity, and ongoing development, we must set forth with new organizational structure and leadership lineups.' After long, careful consideration, he has decided to step down."

The mentor opens paths for disciples. Genuine disciples widen and extend those paths further. Ensuring kosen-rufu movement continuation represents the true path of mentor and disciple.

Great Mountain 40

Shin'ichi Yamamoto's presidential resignation announcement shocked prefecture leaders meeting participants, who could not hide their surprise and confusion. They presumed he was resigning to take full responsibility for recent Nichiren Shoshu troubles and end the priesthood's Soka Gakkai attacks. When Jujo explained that Shin'ichi was voluntarily stepping down, they found it difficult accepting.

It was undeniable that priesthood troubles triggered Shin'ichi's resignation. However, Shin'ichi also strongly wished to make his resignation a positive future move.

Jujo's forehead perspired. Sensing from listeners' expressions that his explanation was insufficiently satisfying, he spoke louder: "President Yamamoto gave the following reasons for stepping down."

He then quoted from notes on Shin'ichi's explanation: "'First, having served as president for nineteen long years, I feel I am approaching my physical endurance limits. Considering Soka Gakkai long-term stability, I wish to pass the baton while still in good health. Now is perfect timing, given that Presidents Makiguchi and Toda's disciples remain prominent while capable young people are emerging steadily.

"'Second, organizational and structural reforms needed responding to society and contemporary demands—under consideration since 1970—have been steadily implemented, with new rules and regulations based on these reforms shortly being adopted. Sound deliberative and decision-making structures are now in place as the Soka Gakkai advances. I can now hand over organizational operations with an easy mind.

"'Third, in recent years, I have devoted considerable energy to promoting peace, culture, and education based on Nichiren Buddhism ideals. I feel I need to make greater efforts and blaze new trails in those areas for Japan and the world. I also would like visiting members nationwide who have worked hard for kosen-rufu and created history alongside me, and do more writing. All this requires time.'"

Jujo continued: "These are the reasons President Yamamoto cited for stepping down."

People, society, and the natural world all undergo changes. Faith in the Mystic Law and Soka Gakkai spirit drive turning those changes into catalysts for great development and growth, giving strength to embark on fresh challenges filled with hope.

Great Mountain 41

Kiyoshi Jujo explains Shin'ichi Yamamoto's decision to resign as Soka Gakkai president to prefecture leaders. Yamamoto will also step down as chief representative of Nichiren Shoshu lay organizations to take responsibility for recent tensions between the Soka Gakkai and the priesthood.

When Yamamoto enters the meeting, members react emotionally. He addresses them directly: "The struggle for kosen-rufu is always turbulent." He assures them he will continue striving in his own capacity and emphasizes that he remains a disciple of Josei Toda.

Great Mountain 42

Yamamoto tells the assembled leaders: "It's important from now on for you to unite around the new president and work together to build a new Soka Gakkai." When members express sadness and ask about his future plans, he explains he will continue as a dedicated Bodhisattva of the Earth, regardless of his formal position.

He addresses youth division members specifically, stating they must not become dependent on him and should embrace this as a new era. Regarding future prefecture visits, he indicates he wants to devote more time to international peace work.

A Tohoku region prefecture leader in his 30s expresses anger, refusing to accept the resignation as final. Yamamoto responds firmly, explaining that his resignation serves the greater good. He references his predecessors—Tsunesaburo Makiguchi and Josei Toda—and calls on leaders to "stand up as courageous successors."

The Executive Council later accepts his resignation, appoints Kiyoshi Jujo as new president, designates Kazumasa Morikawa as general director, and names Yamamoto honorary president.

The newly adopted Soka Gakkai Rules and Regulations provide comprehensive governance structure for the organization. These regulations consolidate previously fragmented guidelines into one coherent framework, organizing 15 chapters covering presidential and general director selection, five-year terms, and operational procedures.

News of the resignation spreads rapidly through media coverage. Members throughout Japan react with shock—some reject the reports entirely, while others struggle to understand the decision. Soka Gakkai headquarters receives numerous calls from distressed members.

Yamamoto remains at the Shinjuku Culture Center, offering encouragement to division leaders particularly affected by his departure. That evening, a press conference at the Seikyo Shimbun building draws dozens of journalists interested in the leadership transition and its implications for Soka Gakkai-Komei Party relations.

New President Jujo expresses his aspirations, noting that "the Soka Gakkai's basic direction will remain unchanged" while announcing plans to foster capable individuals and develop the organization as a peace-building force.

When Yamamoto arrives at the press conference, he addresses reporters with candor. He describes feeling "a great sense of relief, as if I have put down a heavy load," while acknowledging new responsibilities in supporting the Soka Gakkai's continued development under Jujo's leadership.

Regarding his motivations, Yamamoto explains that serving as president for nearly two decades seemed excessive, and he believes new leadership can foster "dynamic, new creative accomplishments." He notes his age at 51 allows continued mentorship.

Yamamoto outlines his future direction, stating he wishes to "devote my time" to peace, education, and culture activities based on Buddhist principles. When reporters ask about political implications, he defers to Jujo while affirming that Soka Gakkai support for the Komei Party will continue.

Following the press conference, Yamamoto meets with youth division leaders, emphasizing that their real test comes when the mentor steps back. He urges them to "stand up resolutely" and encourages each to "become a 'Shin'ichi.'"

Late that evening, Yamamoto leaves the Seikyo Shimbun building. Reflecting privately, he recognizes that while his resignation may calm immediate tensions, deeper challenges remain regarding priesthood oppression and potential future conflicts.

His wife Mineko greets him warmly at home, expressing gratitude for his health and optimism about future opportunities. She reminds him that "now you can begin your true work," reflecting their shared understanding of his broader mission for worldwide kosen-rufu.

Late into the evening, Yamamoto records his thoughts in his diary. Despite the somber mood of the day's events, he resolves with determination: "I am not afraid of adversity! I am a lion." He feels "a passionate fighting spirit" and commits to fostering new leaders and building an indestructible organization.

Throughout the country, emergency meetings announce the leadership changes. In Kansai, leaders recite a poem Yamamoto had dedicated to Toda, declaring: "even though President Yamamoto has stepped down, he will remain our mentor here in Kansai forever!"

The following morning's Seikyo Shimbun announces the transition with the headline "The Completion of the Seven Bells and a New Leadership Lineup." Yamamoto's message to members outlines his three main reasons for stepping down and urges support for the new leadership.

At the April headquarters leaders meeting, members initially feel apprehensive upon noticing Yamamoto's customary speaking position is empty. When he enters, he energizes the room, declaring: "The Gakkai always advances dauntlessly! Remember, lions are always lions!" His confident demeanor restores members' fighting spirit and courage.

At a leaders meeting, Shin'ichi Yamamoto steps down after 19 years as Soka Gakkai president, passing leadership to Kiyoshi Jujo. Shin'ichi uses humor to ease tension, then explains the Seven Bells represented second president Josei Toda's determination for kosen-rufu's global development. He emphasizes organizational renewal ensures longevity, praising Jujo's judgment and experience.

Shin'ichi notes General Director Kazumasa Morikawa's unwavering faith despite limited visibility. He urges members to embrace unity through "many in body, one in mind," citing Nichiren Daishonin's teaching that this spirit enables achieving all goals.

Great Mountain 52

Shin'ichi speaks passionately about maintaining steady progress toward kosen-rufu despite inevitable changes. He stresses individual members should awaken to their personal missions for propagating the Law.

He characterizes the organization as a framework—like a skeleton—that becomes meaningful only through earnest kosen-rufu activities. Leaders must avoid bureaucratic detachment, instead ensuring the organization nourishes members through mutual care.

Shin'ichi emphasizes the Gohonzon's absolute benefit and encourages members to advance without emotional wavering, ultimately seeking their happiness and that of their families.

Great Mountain 53

New president Jujo acknowledges Yamamoto's years of urging leaders toward independence. He confesses initial reluctance about Yamamoto's resignation but recognizes the necessity for sustainable kosen-rufu development.

Jujo acknowledges his limited abilities yet commits to working diligently with member support. He reflects on the selfless efforts of Makiguchi, Toda, and Yamamoto, vowing to carry their spirit into the 21st century with renewed determination daily.

Great Mountain 54

Jujo requests members call him by name rather than "Sensei," reserving that honorific for the three founding presidents. He proposes advancing as equals through mutual encouragement.

He commits to serving members and creating environments for joyful Buddhist practice. The passage notes genuine guidance involves leaders modeling determination and inspiring others through authentic connection rather than hierarchical instruction.

At the Shizuoka Training Center, Shin'ichi contemplates advancing worldwide kosen-rufu through dialogue with global leaders and thinkers. He meets with various divisions, reaffirming the mentor-disciple path and encouraging fresh efforts.

However, Shin'ichi faces restrictions. Attorney Tomomasa Yamawaki and certain Nichiren Shoshu priests plot to isolate him from members and control the organization. They prohibit his attendance at meetings and limit publication coverage to overseas activities.

Their strategy aims severing the mentor-disciple bond that constitutes the Soka Gakkai's lifeblood.

The passage explores the Lotus Sutra's "Bodhisattva Never Disparaging" chapter, describing successive Awesome Sound King Buddhas. Toda suggested viewing these Buddhas collectively as an organization—a harmonious practitioners' community.

"Soka Gakkai Buddha" represents a network of members dedicated to kosen-rufu, connecting through mentor-disciple bonds following Makiguchi and Toda's examples.

Three requirements sustain this eternal organization: lifelong commitment to kosen-rufu's great vow; steadfastly walking the mentor-disciple path; and uniting in "many in body, one in mind" spirit.

Great Mountain 57

Shin'ichi vows creating capable successors to continue kosen-rufu. He recalls January 6, 1951, when Toda, facing business collapse, entrusted everything to him, including the Gakkai, credit union, and commerce ventures.

Amid adversity, Toda emphasized that Shin'ichi's mission was his own mission. He urged unwavering strength regardless of circumstances, exemplifying the mentor-disciple way of striving together undeterred by challenges.

Great Mountain 58

Toda focuses on kosen-rufu's future by entrusting succession to Shin'ichi. He reaffirms that if they remain true to their mission, Nichiren's wishes will be fulfilled.

Shin'ichi responds with tear-filled eyes, pledging lifelong devotion without regret. This dialogue occurs during Toda's desperate struggle.

Shin'ichi recalls the samurai Kusunoki Masashige's farewell to his son Masatsura before the 1336 Battle of Minatogawa. Toda loved the accompanying song "Dainanko," frequently requesting young men's division members perform it, as it expressed his hope for Soka Gakkai youth assuming responsibility for kosen-rufu.

Great Mountain 59

At the Shizuoka Training Center, Shin'ichi deeply comprehends Masashige's and Toda's feelings when entrusting successors before departing for perilous journeys. He understands how profound Toda's January 1951 resolve must have been.

Shin'ichi plays "Dainanko" on the training center's piano with vigor, internalizing its narrative of father and son's separation before battle. He vows to himself: unlike Masashige and Masatsura, ultimately defeated, he will not be defeated and will protect all members while opening new worldwide kosen-rufu spheres.

Great Mountain 60

Shin'ichi reflects that Toda's complete entrustment and comprehensive training—especially through adversity—forged him into a true spiritual leader. Over 19 years as president, he fostered capable successors.

He desires present top leaders to assume full responsibility while he remains available for guidance as a fellow member. This arrangement allows him to develop the youth into outstanding 21st-century successors possessing courage and wisdom.

To communicate this vision, Shin'ichi records himself playing "Dainanko" on piano for youth division representatives. He dedicates the recording to young disciples, calling them toward bold advancement and encouraging each to become a true successor.
