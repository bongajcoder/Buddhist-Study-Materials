Chapter 1: What Is True Happiness?

Part 1: Happiness

"How do I live my life?" and "How can I live the very best life?" are fundamental questions that all humans must confront. While politics, economics, science, philosophy, and religion attempt to address how people should live, Buddhism uniquely provides a coherent answer grounded in the teachings of Shakyamuni Buddha, T'ien-t'ai, and Nichiren Daishonin.

A Thai proverb captures an important distinction: "False happiness makes people become haughty and arrogant. Real happiness makes people joyful and fills them with wisdom and compassion." True happiness is not merely wealth or material comfort, but what President Toda called "absolute happiness"—a state of life where one finds joy regardless of circumstances.

Nichiren Daishonin emphasized that "Both oneself and others together will take joy in their possession of wisdom and compassion." Through Buddhist practice, practitioners can transform life's inevitable sorrows, sufferings, and challenges into sources of strength and meaning.

Faith serves as the engine enabling perseverance through life's difficulties. When chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, practitioners develop the capacity to transform negative experiences into positive growth. The Daishonin teaches that "Myo means to revive, that is, to return to life," describing the Mystic Law's power to revitalize all aspects of existence.

Regarding karma, while past existences shape present circumstances, Nichiren Buddhism emphasizes the present and future. By embracing faith in the Mystic Law, individuals can transform negative karma and develop their lives boundlessly, revealing infinite possibilities within themselves.

Section 1.2: Absolute Happiness and Relative Happiness

How, in the face of the sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death, can we lead positive and fulfilling lives? In this selection, President Ikeda describes a life of limitless value creation in pursuit of absolute happiness by cultivating a strong life force and bounteous wisdom.

What is the purpose of life? It is happiness. The goal of Buddhism and of faith, too, is to become happy.

Nichiren Daishonin writes: "There is no true happiness for human beings other than chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. The Lotus Sutra reads, 'where living beings enjoy themselves at ease.'" "Enjoy themselves at ease" here means being freely able to live the kind of life one desires and wholeheartedly enjoying that life.

If you possess strong life force and abundant wisdom, it is possible to enjoy the challenge of overcoming life's hardships in much the same way that waves make surfing exhilarating and steep mountains give mountaineering its appeal.

Because the Mystic Law is the source of the life force and wisdom for overcoming life's difficulties, the Daishonin states that there is no greater happiness than chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.

Reality is harsh. Please courageously challenge the stern realities of life and win, and win again, in everything—in daily life, work, school, and family relations. The teachings of Buddhism and our practice of faith are the driving force for unlimited improvement.

Where people possess wisdom and life force derived from their Buddhist practice, they can move everything in a brighter, more positive, and more encouraging direction. Wise, genuine practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism are able to enter into a winning rhythm in actuality, not just in theory.

Second Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda gave the following guidance on happiness:

"I would like to say a few words about happiness. There are two kinds of happiness: absolute happiness and relative happiness. Absolute happiness is attaining Buddhahood. Relative happiness means that your everyday wishes are fulfilled one by one—for instance, to have a million yen, a wonderful spouse, fine children, a nice house or clothes, and so on. Such happiness is not of great consequence. Yet everyone is convinced that this is what being happy is all about.

"What, then, is absolute happiness? Absolute happiness means that being alive and here itself is a joy. It also implies a state where one is free of financial worries and enjoys adequate good health, where there is peace and harmony in one's family and one's business prospers, and where all that one sees and hears brings one a wonderful sense of pleasure and joy. When we achieve such a state of life, this world, this strife-ridden saha world, will itself become a pure land. This is what we call attaining the state of Buddhahood.

"How can we achieve this? We must shift from the pursuit of relative happiness to that of absolute happiness. Only our practice of Nichiren Buddhism can make this happen. I'm working furiously to share this truth with others; so I hope you will have utter confidence in my words and lead such lives of absolute happiness."

Founding Soka Gakkai president Tsunesaburo Makiguchi once said: "There are some people who go around saying, 'I saved the money I wanted, bought the house I wanted, so now I can sit back, enjoy a drink, and indulge in a few luxuries. What more can I want in life than that?' This kind of person has no understanding of the true purpose of life." On this point, Mr. Makiguchi clearly stated: "The purpose of life is to create supreme value and to attain the greatest happiness."

The name Soka Gakkai, meaning Value-Creating Society, means an organization whose members are committed to creating supreme value and attaining the greatest happiness.

The purpose of life is to realize this kind of happiness, in other words, absolute happiness. Absolute happiness is something that doesn't change with time; it is eternal and unaffected by external factors, welling forth from the depths of one's life. It is not a transitory thing like worldly status and fortune or some other fleeting satisfaction.

What matters is living in accord with the Law and attaining an elevated state of life based on the Law. The state of life we attain, like the Law itself, is eternal. As practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism, we can make our way as champions of life throughout eternity.

Some people say that happiness is just a state of mind and that if you think you're happy you will be, even if you're suffering from illness or poverty. But if it's just something you're telling yourself without actually feeling any real sense of happiness in the depths of your being, then it's ultimately meaningless.

The "treasures of the heart" that we accumulate through our practice of Nichiren Buddhism will manifest in our lives over time as "treasures of the body" and "treasures of the storehouse."

Every day, I am earnestly praying that you may enjoy comfortable lives, good health, and longevity. And I will continue to pray wholeheartedly for this as long as I live. It is my ardent wish that you each fulfill all of your heart's desires, so that you can declare in your closing days, "My life has been a happy one. I have no regrets. It has been a satisfying life."

This was from a speech at a Rio de Janeiro general meeting, Brazil, February 13, 1993.

Section 1.3: Happiness Is Forged amid Life's Challenges

True happiness is not a matter of chance. It is forged through our earnest efforts to grapple with life's many challenges.

I would like to talk a little about the subject of happiness. Happiness is the fundamental goal of life. It is also the goal of faith. And it is the goal of Buddhism. It is extremely important, then, to understand just what happiness is. I think it is fair to say that people in all ages and places have earnestly sought the answer to the question "What is happiness?" and that, for all too many today, it still remains unanswered.

Some possess great material wealth but are unhappy, perhaps becoming mean-spirited or doing nothing but fighting and quarreling with others. On the other hand, it is quite possible to be materially poor yet enjoy great happiness, being pure-hearted and seeing the beauty in all things like a poet.

Happiness is something very personal. Of two people in similar circumstances, one may be unhappy and the other happy. People are all different and perceive things differently. The reality of people's lives is infinitely diverse.

For instance, there are many women who, though they seem to have good fortune when they are single—possessing youth, beauty, and wealth—end up extremely sad and unhappy when they get married. Living like a princess in a palace, eating food from gold plates, and wearing stylish, immaculate clothing is not happiness. It is in fact stifling and boring, illusory and empty. Though people in such circumstances may seem to be very happy, it is all a show; in reality, their happiness is very fragile and fleeting.

Some, on the other hand, may appear to be suffering misfortune, but are, with strong determination and dignity, forging a life state of happiness that is like a magnificent painting.

By surviving the tragic misfortunes of youth and experiencing many times the hardship of others, we can lead lives that are many times richer, filled with tremendous vitality and inner strength in our final chapter.

If our lives are always smooth sailing, we'll never be able to savor real happiness. It goes without saying that the treasure of happiness cannot be found in a life of ease and idleness. The diamond of happiness can only be found by making our way into the deep mountain recesses of life with great effort and exertion. It is not to be found in idly seeking fun and pleasure amid the bustle and bright lights of the city or in leading an easy existence.

The renowned Scottish poet Robert Burns had this to say about happiness in one of his verses: "If happiness have not her seat and center in the breast, we may be wise, or rich, or great, but never can be blessed! No treasures nor pleasures could make us happy long: the heart always is the part always that makes us right or wrong."

In other words, happiness and unhappiness, ultimately, are found within us. As Nichiren Daishonin says: "It is the heart that is important."

This was from a message to a nationwide young women's division leaders meeting, June 16, 1999.

Section 1.4: Happiness Lies within Us

In this selection, President Ikeda outlines the Buddhist way of life—opening the palace of happiness within our lives instead of seeking it outside, and helping others do the same.

Where is the palace of happiness, the indestructible bastion of happiness, that so many are eagerly seeking? And how is it to be acquired?

In The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, Nichiren Daishonin states: "Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is what is meant by entering the palace of oneself."

The indestructible life state of Buddhahood exists within us all. It could be described as an everlasting palace of happiness, adorned with countless glittering treasures. By embracing faith in the Mystic Law and chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, we can enter this palace within our lives. In other words, the Daishonin teaches that we have the capacity to make the "palace of oneself" shine with supreme brilliance.

People seek all kinds of worldly "palaces of happiness." Some seek wealth or social standing, while others wish for fame, celebrity, or popularity. But none of those things have the permanence of a steadfast mountain peak. In our ever-changing existences, they are like the light of fireflies, flickering beautifully but destined to fade and disappear all too soon.

A life spent in pursuit of the ephemeral, transitory glories of the world is also ephemeral and transitory. Chasing eagerly after forms of happiness that are insubstantial and impermanent is a sad and empty way to live.

As the Daishonin says, one's own highest state of life is an eternal and indestructible palace, a true bastion of happiness.

People may live in fine houses or possess great wealth, but if their hearts are mean and their life conditions are low, they will not be truly happy; they will be dwelling in palaces of misery. In contrast, people who have beautiful, generous hearts and a high life condition, irrespective of their present circumstances, are certain to attain both material and spiritual happiness. This accords with the Buddhist principle of the oneness of life and its environment—that our lives and our surroundings are one and inseparable.

When we open the palace of our own lives, it will eventually lead to the "palace of happiness" opening in others' lives and the "palace of prosperity" opening in society. There is an underlying continuity between the process of opening one's own palace and others doing likewise. This is a wonderful principle of Buddhism.

In today's complex society, where it is all too easy to succumb to negative influences, the wisdom to live mindfully and meaningfully is crucial. Our Buddhist practice enables us to open up our lives and become happy. By continuing to develop and deepen our faith and wisdom, we can become true champions as human beings and ongoing victors in the journey of life.

Supreme happiness is savored by those who, through practicing Nichiren Buddhism, make the palace of their lives shine eternally throughout the three existences of past, present, and future.

You are each building and opening your own palace of happiness day by day through your activities for kosen-rufu. You are certain, as a result, to attain Buddhahood in this lifetime and to become noble champions of happiness dwelling in a great palace of life as vast as the universe itself. I hope you will continue forging ahead on the great path of faith with confidence and optimism, filled with strong conviction and pride.

This was from a speech at a Nagano Prefecture general meeting, Nagano, August 12, 1990.

Section 1.5: Creating a Life of Genuine Freedom

At the 1st Nationwide Women's Division Leaders Meeting in April 1988, President Ikeda proposed designating May 3 as Soka Gakkai Mothers Day. In his speech at this historic meeting, he discussed what it means to live with true freedom.

What is freedom? How can we fully enjoy freedom? Countless sages and philosophers over the centuries have pondered this. In fact, quite apart from this intellectual quest, all people long for freedom. People wish to live freely, without constraints or limitations. This is an innate human desire. Even if we can't clearly define it, we all know that freedom is a vital condition for happiness.

And though all seek freedom, very few attain it in the truest sense.

How can human beings themselves change, and how can we gain an understanding of the real nature of life? These are the most fundamental challenges facing humanity. In this respect, the religious revolution we of the Soka Gakkai are carrying out based on the principles of Nichiren Buddhism is key. You are all noble trailblazers in this endeavor.

Our environment is important, but it is not everything, nor is it absolute. Mr. Toda attained a life state of eternal freedom in a prison cell, the most constrained of environments.

Some of you may feel as if you're "fettered" by your mother-in-law, or "tied down" by your children! Or your husband, your household chores, or your job may at times all seem like heavy iron chains! In your activities for kosen-rufu, too, things may happen that weigh you down so much that you feel bound and tied.

You might exclaim to yourself: "Ah, I'm just a prisoner!" "I'm a servant to my husband and children!"

You may envy some people for the apparent ease of their lives, but if you look closely, you will find that they have no real freedom either.

We must develop inner freedom—a true freedom that exists on a deeper level than what we can achieve by simply changing our intellectual outlook or point of view.

In The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, the Daishonin states: "Outside of each instant of thought of our deluded minds there is no Buddha mind. The births and deaths of us living beings of the nine worlds are the true reality, and hence we can 'freely choose.' Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is being 'free to choose.'" In other words, the world of Buddhahood does not exist apart from our deluded lives as ordinary people in the nine worlds, the life states of hell through bodhisattva. Throughout the cycle of birth and death, we have been fettered by earthly desires, karma, and suffering, but when illuminated by the Mystic Law, our lives reveal their true inherent nature and become utterly free. By chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, the Daishonin tells us, we can live with absolute freedom.

Freedom is not found somewhere apart from the seeming constraints of the nine worlds, of life's realities. Nor is true freedom found in escaping reality. Where is there to escape to? We can't escape from the universe. And more important, we can't escape from our own lives.

As long as we are fettered by karma, afflicted by weakness, defeated by suffering, and held back by misguided ways of thinking, we'll never find freedom anywhere.

The Daishonin says: "Now is the time to break free from the bonds of this realm of birth and death." The practice of the Mystic Law—chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo—is the sword that severs the chains of delusion that shackle us.

The life state of Buddhahood brings us true freedom. It is a state of supreme freedom spanning the three existences—past, present, and future—that brims with the power and wisdom to develop our lives as we wish in accord with our determination in faith. The Mystic Law is the ultimate principle for attaining genuine freedom in the real world.

As the Daishonin states in The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, "The Thus Come One eternally endowed with the three bodies (the Dharma body, reward body, and manifested body), his eternal life span, the distinctions of benefits, the benefits of responding with joy on hearing the Mystic Law—all these are matters that pertain to one's own person. Hence the six sense organs that one received at the time of birth from one's father and mother are all clean and pure and operate freely and without obstruction."

The Daishonin tells us that all these qualities and benefits he enumerates apply to us. They are taught in the "Life Span," "Distinctions in Benefits," "The Benefits of Responding with Joy," and "Benefits of the Teacher of the Law" chapters of the Lotus Sutra.

Each word and phrase of the Lotus Sutra has direct relevance to our lives. The teachings of Nichiren Buddhism are not abstract ideals.

In particular, the Daishonin states that the six sense organs—namely, sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch, and consciousness, which we are born with and comprise our physical and mental awareness—are originally pure, free, and unobstructed.

The purpose of our Buddhist faith and practice is to achieve such a state of untrammeled personal freedom. True and eternal freedom is attained by living aligned and in rhythm with the Mystic Law, by chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and sharing it with others.

This is the way to become an awakened, liberated person, to achieve a free, expansive, unobstructed state of being, and lead a truly unencumbered life in which we can savor the utmost happiness and joy to our heart's content. That's why no matter what happens, we must never stop practicing.

The religious revolution the Soka Gakkai is carrying out is a struggle to liberate humanity, to liberate all people, so that they can enjoy eternal inner freedom.

Such inner freedom doesn't come by sitting around and waiting for it; it must be fought for and won. To that end, I ask that each of you strive to gain mastery over yourself. A commitment to self-mastery is the foundation from which everything will follow in accord with the Buddhist principle of "consistency from beginning to end," enabling you to create a life of genuine happiness and freedom.

This was from a speech at a nationwide women's division leaders meeting, Tokyo, April 27, 1988.

Section 1.6: The Six Conditions for Happiness

President Ikeda presents six points for attaining happiness in this speech at an SGI general meeting in the U.S.A., and stresses that all of them are included in the practice of Nichiren Buddhism.

In his writings, Nichiren Daishonin states, "You must not spend your lives in vain and regret it for ten thousand years to come."

How should we live our lives? What is the most valuable and worthwhile way to live? A well-known Japanese poem goes: "The life of a flower is short; sufferings only are there many." The meaning of these lines is that flowers suddenly come into bloom and then, just as suddenly, their petals fall and scatter; ultimately, the only thing that lasts for a long time is suffering. Life, indeed, may be like that in some ways.

A philosopher once remarked that perhaps the only way to determine happiness or unhappiness in life is by adding up, at the end of one's days, all the joys and all the sorrows one had experienced and basing one's final evaluation on whichever figure was larger.

Despite having illustrious positions in society or great material wealth, there are many people who fail to become happy. Despite enjoying wonderfully happy marriages or relationships, people must ultimately be parted from the person they love through death. Being separated from loved ones is one of the unavoidable sufferings inherent in the human condition. There are many who, despite gaining great fame and popularity, die after long, agonizing illnesses. Despite being born with exceptional beauty, not a few have been brought to misery by this seeming advantage.

Where is happiness to be found? How can we become happy? These are fundamental questions of life, and human beings are no doubt destined to pursue them eternally. The teachings of Nichiren Buddhism and faith in the Mystic Law provide fundamental answers to these questions.

Ultimately, happiness rests on our establishing a solid sense of self. Happiness based on such externals as possessing a fine house or a good reputation is "relative happiness." It is not a firm, unchanging "absolute happiness." Some might seem to be in the most fortunate circumstances, but if they feel only emptiness and pain, then they cannot be considered happy.

Some people live in truly splendid houses yet do nothing but fight in them. Some people work for famous companies and enjoy a prestige that many envy yet are always being shouted at by their superiors, are left exhausted from heavy workloads, and feel no sense of joy or fulfillment in life.

Happiness does not lie in outward appearances or in vanity. It is a matter of what we feel inside; it is a deep resonance in our lives. I would venture, therefore, that the first condition for happiness is fulfillment.

To be filled each day with a rewarding sense of exhilaration and purpose, a sense of tasks accomplished and deep fulfillment—people who feel this way are happy. Those who have this sense of satisfaction even if they are extremely busy are much happier than those who have free time on their hands but feel empty inside.

As practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism, we get up in the morning and do gongyo. Some perhaps may do so rather reluctantly! Nevertheless, doing gongyo is itself a truly great and noble thing. Gongyo is a solemn ceremony in which we are, in a manner of speaking, gazing out across the universe; it is a dialogue with the universe.

Doing gongyo and chanting daimoku before the Gohonzon represent the dawn, the start of a new day, in our lives; it is the sun rising; it gives us a profound sense of contentment in the depths of our being that nothing can surpass. Even on this point alone, we are truly fortunate.

Some people appear to be happy but actually start off the day feeling depressed. A husband might be admonished by his wife in the morning and begin his day dejected, wondering, "How on earth did I get into such a marriage?" He will savor neither happiness nor contentment. Just by looking at our mornings, it is clear that we in the SGI lead lives of profound worth and satisfaction.

In addition, each of you is striving to do your best in your job or other responsibilities and to win in all areas of life while using your spare time to work for Buddhism, kosen-rufu, people's happiness, and the welfare of society. In this Latter Day of the Law teeming with perverse individuals, you are exerting yourselves energetically, often amid many hardships and obstacles, chanting daimoku for others' happiness, traveling long distances to talk with friends and show them warm concern and understanding. You are truly bodhisattvas. There is no nobler life, no life based on a loftier philosophy. Each of you is translating this unsurpassed philosophy into action and spreading its message far and wide. To possess a philosophy of such profound value is itself the greatest fortune. Accordingly, the second condition for happiness is to possess a profound philosophy.

The third condition for happiness is to possess conviction. We live in an age in which people can no longer clearly distinguish what is right or wrong, good or evil. This is a global trend. If things continue in this way, humanity is destined for chaos and moral decay. In the midst of such times, you are upholding and earnestly practicing Nichiren Buddhism, a teaching of the highest good.

In "The Opening of the Eyes," the Daishonin writes: "This I will state. Let the gods forsake me. Let all persecutions assail me. Still I will give my life for the sake of the Law." In this same letter, he instructs his believers not to be swayed by temptations or threats, however great—such as being offered the rulership of Japan or being told that one's parents will be beheaded.

The important thing is holding on resolutely to one's convictions, come what may, just as the Daishonin teaches. People who possess such unwavering conviction will definitely become happy. Each of you is such an individual.

The fourth condition is living cheerfully and vibrantly. Those who are always complaining and grumbling make not only themselves but everyone else around them miserable and unhappy. By contrast, those who always live positively and filled with enthusiasm—those who possess a cheerful and sunny disposition that lifts the spirits and brightens the hearts of everyone they meet—are not only happy themselves but are a source of hope and inspiration for others.

Those who are always wearing long, gloomy expressions whenever you meet them and who have lost the ability to rejoice and feel genuine delight or wonder lead dark, cheerless existences.

On the other hand, those who possess good cheer can view even a scolding by a loved one, such as a spouse or partner, as sweet music to their ears, or can greet a child's poor report card as a sign of great potential for improvement!

Viewing events and situations in this kind of positive light is important. The strength, wisdom, and cheerfulness that accompany such an attitude lead to happiness.

To regard everything in a positive light or with a spirit of goodwill, however, does not mean being foolishly gullible and allowing people to take advantage of our good nature. It means having the wisdom and perception to actually move things in a positive direction by seeing things in their best light, while all the time keeping our eyes firmly focused on reality.

Faith and the teachings of Buddhism enable us to develop that kind of character. The acquisition of such character is a more priceless treasure than any other possession in life.

The fifth condition for happiness is courage. Courageous people can overcome anything. The cowardly, on the other hand, because of their lack of courage, fail to savor the true, profound joys of life. This is most unfortunate.

The sixth condition for happiness is tolerance. Those who are tolerant and broad-minded make people feel comfortable and at ease. Narrow and intolerant people who berate others for the slightest thing or who make a great commotion each time some problem arises just exhaust and intimidate everyone. Leaders must be tolerant and have a warm approachability that makes people feel relaxed and comfortable. Not only are those who possess a heart as wide as the ocean happy themselves, but all those around them are happy, too.

The six conditions I have just mentioned are all ultimately encompassed in the single word faith. A life based on faith in the Mystic Law is a life of unsurpassed happiness.

The Daishonin declares, "Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is the greatest of all joys." I hope all of you will savor the truth of these words deep in your lives and show vibrant actual proof of that joy.

This was from a speech at an SGI general meeting, U.S.A., June 23, 1996.

Section 1.7: Confronting Life's Fundamental Sufferings Head-On

In this selection, President Ikeda stresses that the Soka Gakkai and Nichiren Buddhism directly tackle the universal and inescapable issues of birth, aging, sickness, and death, and clarifies that the path to true happiness is to be found in that pursuit.

What is the purpose of life? It is to become happy. What, then, is true happiness? Can fame, wealth, or social status, no matter how immense, bring us true happiness?

Such things alone do not create lasting happiness at life's deepest level. Nor can they solve the most fundamental sufferings of existence—birth, aging, sickness, and death. It is for this very reason that Nichiren Daishonin expounded his teaching.

Birth—the pain of being born and of living. There are innumerable sufferings in life. And there is also our karma to deal with. There are accidents that we cannot anticipate. There are such problems as divorce, difficulties with our children, and frustrations at work. The question is how do we overcome all of these and other sufferings?

Aging—the suffering of growing older. Right now, you are all young; you are all healthy and possess the beauty of youth. But you will invariably age and grow old. There's no inoculation against this, and the most expensive medicine will not cure you of old age.

Sickness—the suffering of illness. Some suffer from cancer. Others suffer from mental or spiritual illnesses. Life is a battle against myriad diseases and disorders. Second Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda often said that there is an illness called poverty, just as there is an illness called meanness of spirit. He also asserted that the karma of being hated by others and ending life in defeat can also be termed a kind of illness. It is the power of the Mystic Law that cures these kinds of illness that afflict the body and mind at a fundamental level.

Death—this is the most uncompromising of the four sufferings. None of us here today will be alive in 100 years. As the French literary giant Victor Hugo declared: "We are all under sentence of death but with a sort of indefinite reprieve."

There are many ways of dying as well. Some die by their own hand, others are murdered. Some suffer unspeakable agony before they die. How should we view our inexorable fate of death? How can we overcome the suffering it causes? These are crucial questions. And what happens after death? Do we still exist? Or is there nothing? If we do exist, in what state do we exist? Such things are beyond ordinary human understanding.

The sufferings of birth, aging, sickness, and death are universal to humankind. They are the basic issues we face in our unending search for happiness. Yet almost all of society's leaders sidestep them. They furtively avert their eyes from the very issues that any leader who feels a sense of responsibility for the welfare of the people cannot possibly neglect. This is a great misfortune for the people.

The Soka Gakkai confronts these fundamental problems head-on. And Nichiren Daishonin reveals the means for resolving them completely.

He elucidates the Mystic Law, which enables us to serenely overcome the four sufferings and all other kinds of hardships and obstacles, and in fact even use our sufferings as an impetus to propel us forward as we lead lives pervaded by the four virtues of eternity, happiness, true self, and purity.

Life is a struggle. Reality is a struggle. Nichiren Daishonin teaches that Buddhism is about winning. He exhorts us to be victorious. So we must win in life. To embrace the Mystic Law is to grasp the sword of victory. We can triumph over all. We can triumph and enjoy our lives. A "person of faith" is synonymous with "a person of victory."

Therefore, I hope all of you will be victorious in your lives. Live your lives so that you can declare: "I have no regrets. I enjoyed my life. I encouraged many others and gave them hope. It was a good life."

This was from a speech at an SGI-USA youth division general meeting, U.S.A., March 14, 1993.
