Chapter 20: Encouragement for Youth

Section 20.2: The Problems of Youth Are Themselves a Source of Light

With warm compassion and empathy, President Ikeda wholeheartedly encourages young people. He urges them to learn to encourage themselves, to like themselves, and to use their problems as fuel to shine ever more brightly.

Youth is a painful time. It is full of problems. But dealing with such troubles helps us grow as human beings. When we look back at the times we really suffered, the times we thought were the most miserable, we see that these were the most precious times of all.

That's why we need to grapple with our problems head-on, instead of trying to escape them. That is the most direct way forward.

If you're sad and lonely, then you should acknowledge those feelings. Don't try to distract yourself from them with shallow amusements. Don't diminish them. Go through those feelings, bravely weather them, and turn them into nourishment for your growth.

People, just like flowers, need light. People's hearts wither when no one values or cares about them. So please be the sun that imparts bright light to all.

People, like flowers, also need water. Our hearts wither if we don't encourage ourselves, make ourselves happy, and spark our own enthusiasm.

Those who can encourage themselves are truly inspiring. They understand the pain and suffering of others. Find the words, strength, and wisdom to bring happiness to your own heart. When you're feeling down, lift up your own spirits.

If you can't like yourself, you can't love others.

If you're shy and sensitive, that's perfectly fine. Being thick-skinned and insensitive is not a requirement for being an adult. Flowers aren't made of concrete, either; they are soft, delicate, and fragile. Those who remain sensitive to others' thoughts and feelings their whole lives are truly strong.

Our destiny does not come from somewhere outside us; it is shaped within our own hearts, day by day. If we find life boring, it might be because we've let ourselves become boring. If life seems empty, it might be because we've allowed ourselves to grow empty and shallow. If we feel fed up with life, then life might actually be saying the same to us! We can only lead lives that match the way we live them.

If you get average grades in school, that's fine, but please make sure you excel as a human being. Grades aren't the only measure of how smart or capable you are, and they really matter little in life over the long term. However, I hope you will earnestly pursue those questions that spark your curiosity, and think long and hard about them.

Also, I hope you will become a person who is willing, at the crucial moment, to stand up for truth and justice, regardless of the personal cost. As the presence of such individuals grows, the world will become a more beautiful place.

Somewhere in the world a mission is waiting for you—a mission that only you can fulfill. It is waiting for you, counting the days. Since that is the case, you must live, you must keep going until the day you encounter your mission!

To shine, you must burn with an inner light, and the fire that produces that inner light is fueled by problems and suffering.

The problems of youth are themselves a source of light.

Section 20.3: You Are Each a Precious Individual with a Special Mission

President Ikeda stresses that we are all precious beings, each born with our own unique mission.

Everyone has a mission. We were born because we have a mission. That's why we must live our lives and persevere through all.

The Japanese word for mission means to "use one's life." For what purpose do we use our lives? For what purpose have we been born in this world, sent forth from the universe?

Buddhism views the universe as one giant life. If we compare it to a vast ocean, each individual life is like a wave on that ocean. When a wave rises from the ocean, that is "life"; when it merges back into the ocean, that is "death." In both life and death, each individual life is one with the universe.

The whole universe supports and assists in the birth of a single life. All of you have been sent here with the blessings and congratulations of the entire universe!

All life is equally precious. There is no hierarchy among living beings. Each being has a unique nature. Each person's life is as precious as the universe in its entirety—it is one with the universe and just as important.

Nichiren Daishonin writes in this regard: "Life is the foremost of all treasures" (WND-1, 1125); "The Buddha says that life is something that cannot be purchased even for the price of an entire major world system" (WND-1, 983); and "One day of life is more valuable than all the treasures of the major world system" (WND-1, 955).

This is why we must never take our own lives, why violence, too, is wrong, and why we mustn't harm or bully others. It is because none of us has the right to inflict harm on life, which is so precious.

Youth is a time when we ponder the meaning of our existence. It is like a "second birth." Our first birth is our physical birth. The second, our youth, is the time of our "birth" as human beings in the real sense. That's why it's painful. It requires the same kind of struggle and exertion as a chick breaking out of its egg.

The crucial thing is to never give up in that process. As you struggle and strive to find your way, please chant, think, study, talk with friends, and tackle the things you need to do now. If you continue to challenge yourself without giving up, you will come to see the mission that is yours and yours alone to accomplish.

Section 20.4: Seeking Out Challenges for Self-Development in One's Youth

President Ikeda explains that a springtime of exhilarating victory comes to those who remain true to their vow and convictions, actively seek out challenges, and develop themselves in their youth.

Only those who have experienced the harshness of winter can truly know the joy of spring. The same is true of life.

The Swiss philosopher Carl Hilty asserted: "What joy is, is essentially known only to those who have suffered much. Others know only pleasure, which is in no way similar."

Those who haven't experienced suffering cannot know real joy—how true that is!

Hilty also wisely observed: "Happiness in life is not a matter of having few or no hardships but, rather, of victoriously and gloriously overcoming them all."

True happiness in life lies in triumphing over every obstacle, he says. This point of view is quite similar to the Buddhist teaching that sufferings arising from earthly desires are the springboard to enlightenment.

There are some people who try to make their way through life without exerting any genuine effort, who try to profit and get ahead without putting in any hard work. Do they achieve real happiness? False veneers are eventually exposed, and pretense can only get one so far.

In the natural world, winter always turns to spring. What is needed in our human world for that to happen?

Hilty declared: "Break through!—this short phrase has an almost magical effect each time we face an inner crisis."

Persevere through all; continue, no matter what difficulty. Persevering is the secret to everything, he concludes.

To paraphrase Hilty: When your mind seems ready to drift off to sleep, or when you are overcome by a feeling of lethargy—tell yourself: Break through! This short phrase delivers a shock to a healthy will and awakens it. The elevated spirit is once again free to move toward the truth, toward what's right and just. When you feel yourself succumbing to feelings of futility or apathy, rouse yourself and press on through!

We all experience problems and deadlocks from time to time—it might be with Soka Gakkai activities, with work, or with human relations. That's the time to persevere. Continue pressing forward and win your own victory. That's the only way.

There may be times when life itself seems a burden, when we feel trapped or weighed down by something, when we feel passive and a victim of circumstances, or when we feel somehow lost. Those are the times to shed our passivity and turn it into initiative, telling ourselves, "I'm going to follow through on this path!" "I'm going to carry out my mission for today!" When we decide to do so, a genuine spring will dawn in our hearts, and flowers will start to bloom.

Persevering for us means continuing in our efforts to chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and share Nichiren Buddhism with one person after another. We who know this sure and practical way for transforming winter into spring are fortunate indeed.

It is my fervent wish that a steady stream of outstanding Soka Gakkai leaders for the 21st century will emerge from the youth division. Because of my strong hopes in that regard, I want to reiterate my advice that you continue to seek out challenges.

Mr. Toda often said: "Why did I become the president of the Soka Gakkai? It is because I lost my wife. I lost my beloved daughter. And because I have experienced all kinds of bitter hardships. That is the reason I became president." Because he had undergone great hardships, he was qualified to be president—this was Mr. Toda's philosophy.

Experiencing various hardships enables us to deepen our faith.

I still vividly recall the words of the Japanese industrialist and founder of the Panasonic Corporation, Konosuke Matsushita, with whom I shared many conversations: "Mr. Ikeda, how true it is that people ought to struggle during their youth and even deliberately seek out hard work!"

These days, many people try to avoid hard work. They seem to feel that working hard is old-fashioned or a waste of energy. However, this is certainly not the case. In essence, all of our efforts are for our own sake.

We live in an age in which people can easily indulge themselves as much as they like and leave everything up to others. Making efforts to train and develop oneself is not considered important. But such an attitude has caused many to lose their sense of purpose and identity.

Because of this prevailing climate, those resolved to actively seek out hard work will gain great reward and benefit. Those who thoroughly develop themselves and forge an undefeatable self will be victorious.

Where can we find such a wonderful realm of self-development? It is here in the Soka Gakkai. Here, we find the path for securing supreme victory in life.

From a speech at a Soka Gakkai Headquarters leaders meeting, Tokyo, June 28, 1995.

Section 20.5: Always Look to the Future

President Ikeda stresses the importance of living with a strong, positive, forward-looking spirit in one's youth, a time for building the foundations of one's life.

The German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche wrote: "Let where you are going, not where you come from, henceforth be your honour! Your will and your foot that desires to step out beyond you—let them be your new honour!"

His message is that everything starts from now! Always look to the future! Buddhism also teaches the spirit of focusing on the present and the future.

A meaningful life—and, in particular, a meaningful youth—is built not by focusing on the past, but on how you live from now on. That positive, forward-looking attitude is the key to greatness and victory.

To continually apply yourself to the task of going beyond where you are today—that spirit of self-improvement is the very heart of youth.

President Toda urged young people to "strive constantly to improve themselves, to become more dignified and cultured, and to establish a better, greater self."

Develop yourself! This was his message to the youth. He also often encouraged them to read books and ponder things deeply.

You are the future leaders of society and kosen-rufu. That's why you need to think more deeply and strive more vigorously than those around you. Please take the initiative in working and studying hard.

When you adopt that attitude, your eyes will sparkle and you'll enjoy a sense of fulfillment. If, on the other hand, you try to avoid hard work, you will lose your youthful freshness and vitality.

I continue to challenge myself, taking action and engaging in dialogue, with the spirit to put a week's worth, a month's worth, of effort into each day. I do it all for you, my fellow members, and for kosen-rufu. I never forget this guiding purpose.

Living without working to improve oneself leads to stagnation and, ultimately, self-defeat.

There are those who fail to work on their own growth and development, using only their wits and wiles to get by. But the closing chapter of their lives is often empty and sad. They end up regretting the choices they made. They wish they could go back to their youth and do things differently.

There is a time for everything. If you have every material comfort and the freedom to do anything you please from the time of your youth, you are actually rather unfortunate. It's important that you forge inner strength and develop yourself in your youth. With such a foundation, it's only natural that once you reach a certain age your life will blossom, and you'll enjoy both spiritual and material rewards. This is the correct path in life.

From a speech at a Chugoku Region youth peace general meeting, Tokyo, May 7, 1995.

Section 20.7: Live with an Invincible Spirit

Youth can be a time of emotional ups and downs, of being overly swayed by circumstances and feeling a sense of hopelessness and despair. For that reason, in this guidance for junior high school division members, President Ikeda stresses the importance of young people forging ahead with an invincible spirit.

Fortunate circumstances don't guarantee happiness, and, conversely, hard circumstances don't guarantee that one will be unhappy.

Our environment doesn't decide our happiness; we do. We are either defeated by our environment or we triumph over it. That's what determines our happiness.

This doesn't just apply to school. There are many troubling, painful, unpleasant, and worrisome things in life.

When you face such things, you have two options. You can complain, blame the environment, and be defeated. Some may express sympathy for you, but, ultimately, you're the one to lose out, and anything you say will really be just an excuse. The second option is to live with an invincible spirit, blazing your own way regardless of your environment. The choice is up to you.

In India, the caste system remains a deeply rooted social custom. It divides people into different social roles and ranks from birth. But there is someone who, though born into the lowest caste, rose to become president of India.

That is the president in 2000, Mr. K. R. Narayanan, with whom I have been friends for some time. Mr. Narayanan was the fourth of seven children. The family was destitute. Their home had no bath, and he was always hungry. Going to school each day meant walking seven kilometers there and back. During the rainy season, the mud came up to his ankles. On those long walks, he was always reading. He couldn't afford to buy books, so he would eagerly read any newspapers or books he came across and take detailed notes.

Recognizing his love of study, Mr. Narayanan's elder siblings gave up their chance to go to elementary school so that he could get an education. But even then, the family often could not afford to pay his tuition. He was punished for this by being forced to stand outside the classroom, but he refused to let this get him down. He would simply strain to hear every word of instruction going on inside. Eventually, he was awarded a scholarship, one that had been established by Mahatma Gandhi, and was able to continue his studies. He graduated from university at the top of his class and became a diplomat. He recalls his youthful hardships with a smile. Because a diplomat had to be thick-skinned, he says, being forced to stand outside where all of his classmates could see him was good training.

He is a strong person. Strong people are happy. Happiness is found in a strong, resilient spirit.

It's possible for us to open a great path of hope so long as we don't succumb to the weakness of blaming others for everything that happens to us. We have to decide, "It's all up to me! I have to be strong." Complaining and making excuses is very unattractive. Blaming everything on your teachers, your parents, your friends—blaming others is not a very admirable way to live.

Napoleon Bonaparte declared that the environment was his to make. Decide never to blame your environment, but instead to create the environment you desire.

I have always believed that, as young people with a mission, you cannot be defeated. Because you were born to win! Therefore, take aim at your dreams and strive your hardest to make them come true.

Even if you take a long, roundabout way to get there, what matters is that you succeed in crossing the finish line in the end. Become strong. Strong people are happy people.

Those who respond to painful circumstances by gritting their teeth and trying their hardest can obtain a rare and elusive treasure. In contrast, weak people, no matter how favorable their circumstances, will somehow turn those circumstances into a negative influence in their lives.

The way of life you choose determines your future. No one else makes the decision. No one else is to blame. It's entirely up to you, to how you live your life.

If you just let your environment control you, it becomes the main actor in your life. That is a regrettable way to live. You are the main actor, the one who determines the course of your own life.

From Dialogue of Hope, published in Japanese in June 2003.

Section 20.8: To Young Women's Division Members

On entering a new century, President Ikeda offers important guidance for young women's division members with the wish that each one of them without exception will become genuinely happy.

In a letter to a female disciple, the lay nun Ueno, Nichiren Daishonin writes: "Neither the pure land nor hell exists outside oneself; both lie only within one's own heart. Awakened to this, one is called a Buddha; deluded about it, one is called an ordinary person" (WND-1. 456).

Happiness and hell are within you, inside your own hearts and minds.

Being a celebrity doesn't guarantee happiness. Neither does popularity. Honors and accolades are not true happiness, nor is wealth.

True happiness lies in tapping the inner source of eternal, indestructible, absolute happiness that is Nam-myoho-renge-kyo—shining in the depths of your being that is still a work in progress—as you strive to cultivate your own life. This is the essence of Buddhism.

The aim of our faith is for us to win in life. Buddhism is a set of principles to enable us to do so.

To gloriously triumph in life, we need to strive just as always in our daily lives, carrying out our everyday responsibilities, and forge ahead with ever greater strength on the road of kosen-rufu.

When you do that, your life will shine with an endlessly noble spirit. The countless Buddhas of the ten directions and three existences will protect all of you—inspiring, unsung emissaries of the Buddha—as foremost champions of the world.

Don't allow yourself to be swept away by illusions. You cannot become happy by following people who are ignorant of the principles for genuine happiness. The absolutely correct way is to follow the Buddhism of Nichiren Daishonin, a true champion of humanity who left us the great pathway to happiness.

Never forget that a wonderful luminous realm of eternal victory awaits those who embrace this teaching.

The course of your life is determined by whose lead you follow. Do you follow calculating politicians, vain pretenders, or greedy schemers? Do not be deceived. Your decisive choice must be to follow Nichiren Daishonin, the entity of the universe itself.

No matter what kind of father, mother, or siblings you may have, if you attain Buddhahood, you can lead all of them to enlightenment as well. The heart of Soka lies in building a happy, strong self.

Many labor under the delusion that marriage equals happiness. Remaining single by no means excludes you from enjoying happiness. The important thing is to build an unshakable self, set on a foundation of correct faith. This is the way to true happiness.

Birds who don't fly lose the ability to do so. They lose the use of their wings and can't soar into the skies of happiness. An Olympic athlete who doesn't run or doesn't train cannot win. Lazy people who don't strive, don't act, don't advance, end up losing in life.

Striving and progressing for some purpose or goal—this is the essence of happiness. If, from your youth, you strive tirelessly for the sake of others, for Buddhism, what an amazing person you will become! While carrying out your human revolution, you will build a truly expansive state of life.

As you may know, my wife, Kaneko, attended the inaugural meeting of the young women's division as a group leader in 1951, and with Tokyo as her main stage of activity from her youth, has dedicated herself wholeheartedly to kosen-rufu.

Proud to be a Tokyo young women's division member like all of you, she braved the cold winter winds during the historic February Campaign of Kamata Chapter in 1952 to engage actively in sharing the Daishonin's Buddhism with friends and encouraging members.

Note on terminology: The February Campaign refers to February 1952, when President Ikeda, then an adviser to Tokyo's Kamata Chapter, initiated a dynamic propagation campaign. Together with the Kamata members, he broke through the previous monthly record of some 100 new member households by introducing Nichiren Buddhism to 201 new member households.

Her parent's home was also a center for Soka Gakkai activities, so she invited her superiors at work to discussion meetings, helped make gatherings bright and enjoyable, and smilingly greeted the members who gathered there day and night. As a young women's division member, she would happily and kindly read picture books with the children of women's division members during meetings.

Though no one was watching or praising her, she carried out the vow she made to President Makiguchi and worked to support President Toda. She assisted her mother, the chapter women's division leader, encouraged her father, the district men's division leader, and continued to strive for kosen-rufu with dedication, sincerity, and perseverance.

That exhilarating time as a young women's division member, my wife recalls, was the most memorable period of her life, when she built the foundation for her life and her Buddhist faith and practice.

Your fellow members around the world are all earnestly walking the path to absolute happiness. The Mystic Law, the great underlying principle of the universe! There is no other path to peace in the 21st century.

Let's advance along that path together! Social standing, wealth, position, and family background have nothing to do with happiness. And thinking you would be happy if things just went the way you wanted, or if you could just do this or that, is not really Buddhism.

"It is the heart that is important" (WND-1, 1000), declares the Daishonin. The heart is faith, and faith is an essential requirement for happiness.

The key is to become happy right here and now, in your present situation and circumstances, just as you are.

My young friends, be pioneers of life! Be great victors of happiness! Don't lose yourself in idle, empty, mundane pleasures and amusements! Take your place at the head of the march to fundamental happiness!

All of the heavenly deities as well as the Buddhas and bodhisattvas throughout the universe, radiant and dancing with joy, will protect your vibrant lives, shower you with the highest praises, and guide you on your journey to happiness.

From a message to a Tokyo young women's division chapter leaders meeting, February 9, 2001.

Section 20.9: True Happiness Is Having Good Friends

Having good friends and seniors in faith is the key to leading lives of genuine happiness, President Ikeda says, sharing important guidance for young women's division members.

Today, I'd like to discuss something important with you, the young women's division members: true happiness.

Does getting married mean you'll be happy, and does not getting married mean you'll be unhappy? The answer to these questions is no. Life is not that simple. It is extremely complex and subtle. A person who has been happy until now may fall into the depths of despair tomorrow. A person whose life has been a series of unhappy events may suddenly experience a complete change of fortune. Moreover, people who may appear to enjoy the happiest of circumstances may in fact be miserable inside. And likewise, people whose circumstances seem unfortunate may actually lead the most fulfilling and vibrant lives.

Happiness is a matter of the heart. Our hearts are precious vessels endowed with the treasure of Buddhahood. When we strive in faith and practice and reveal our Buddhahood, we can walk the sure and steady path to happiness and attain a state of complete fulfillment and satisfaction. Nichiren Daishonin writes: "Fortune comes from one's heart and makes one worthy of respect" (WND-1, 1137). I hope that all of you will follow this correct course in life. To do so, it's crucial to continue advancing in the pure realm of faith that is the Soka Gakkai.

In The Record of the Orally Transmitted Teachings, the Daishonin states: "Nichiren and his followers, those who chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, one and all will 'together reach the place where the treasure is.' This one word 'together' means that, as long as they are together with Nichiren, they will reach the treasure land, the realm of Buddhahood. But if they are not together with him, they will fall into the great citadel of the Avichi Hell, the hell of incessant suffering." (OTT, 77–78)

The Soka Gakkai has striven in faith, practice, and study in complete accord with the Daishonin's teachings. It has fought resolutely against the three obstacles and four devils and the three powerful enemies.

Note on terminology: The three obstacles and four devils are various obstacles and hindrances to the practice of Buddhism. The three obstacles are the obstacle of earthly desires, the obstacle of karma, and the obstacle of retribution. The four devils are the hindrance of the five components, the hindrance of earthly desires, the hindrance of death, and the hindrance of the devil king. The three powerful enemies are three types of arrogant people who persecute those who propagate the Lotus Sutra in the evil age after Shakyamuni Buddha's death, described in the "Encouraging Devotion" chapter of the Lotus Sutra. The Great Teacher Miao-lo of China summarizes them as arrogant lay people, arrogant priests, and arrogant false sages.

We have exerted ourselves "bravely and vigorously" (LSOC2, 56) for kosen-rufu as a harmonious community of practitioners united in the spirit of "many in body, one in mind," just as the Daishonin instructs. Therefore, to live out our lives with the Soka Gakkai is the only path by which we can walk together with the Daishonin and "reach the place where the treasure is."

In concrete terms, it is essential for you, our young women's division members, to have good seniors in faith and good friends—people you can talk with about anything. Don't separate yourselves from such good people. Please don't suffer alone with your problems, making reckless choices and ending up on the wrong course.

If you allow bad friends to influence you, you'll head in a negative direction. But if you form connections with good people, you will experience positive growth. This is human nature, and it is my conclusion after observing countless people over the years.

There's no need to be preoccupied with getting married either. Whether to get married or when to get married are minor issues from the perspective of life's eternity. Marriage by no means decides the outcome of your life. If you persist in your faith, you are sure to attain happiness. My wish is that all our young women's division members will advance confidently along the path of Soka filled with hope and courage.

At the same time, I call on the members of the women's and men's divisions to warmly and sincerely advise the young women's division members, offering them wholehearted support and encouragement.

Your youth is incredibly precious, an extremely important period when you lay the foundation for the rest of your life. While you are young, I hope you will seek out good mentors, learn from good seniors, foster mutually supportive relationships with good friends, and raise good juniors. I also hope you will be daughters who treasure your parents.

I'd like to present our young women's division members with these words of Hryhory (Gregory) Skovoroda, often called the "Ukrainian Socrates": "I pity the wealthy: Let them rule over what they want. As for me, as long as I have friends, I consider myself not only fortunate, but most fortunate."

The young women of Soka cherish a true philosophy and work alongside true comrades in faith to expand our circle of true friendship. They are walking a path to genuine happiness far superior to any enjoyed by those who seek only wealth or power.

From a speech at a young women's division and women's division joint conference, Tokyo, February 14, 2006.

Note on reference: The Skovoroda quote is from The Complete Correspondence of Hryhory Skovoroda: Philosopher and Poet, translated by Eleonora Adams and Michael M. Naydan, edited by Liliana M. Naydan, published in 2016, page 59.

Section 20.11: Trustworthiness Is the Greatest Asset for Youth

Reflecting on his own struggles in his youth, President Ikeda stresses how important it is for young people to gain others' trust and not be afraid of making mistakes.

Trust is an essential requirement for human life. For young people, in particular, trustworthiness is their greatest asset. A young person who fails to build trust is very unlikely to succeed.

Trust is difficult to build, yet easy to destroy. The trust one has worked hard to accumulate over a decade can be lost by a thoughtless word or action at a crucial moment. Carefully crafted facades tend to crumble at a critical juncture.

Those who persevere through hardships to carry out their own mission will ultimately win the trust of all around them.

I reserve the highest respect and admiration for those who, though having jobs that may be unexciting and out of the limelight, conscientiously apply themselves to their work, day in and day out, and patiently keep striving to improve themselves, one step at a time.

Though the trust of others is indeed precious, it can be ruinous for young people to adopt an overly cautious attitude, always playing it safe. The failures you experience at times in your youth can be incredibly valuable in building the foundation for your future. Young people should be aware of the fact that they are not perfect, and try to live each day with courage, true to themselves.

Those who lead resolute lives, who possess an invincible spirit and are able to rise up from the depths of despair like phoenixes from the ashes, are much more likely to achieve brilliant victory in the end than those who have never experienced failure or disappointment. We should not be afraid of failure or mistakes, but of letting them defeat us.

Allowing one or two setbacks to discourage us is foolish. Life is a long, long journey. However wonderful or successful our lives may seem along the way, if we end up suffering unhappiness and defeat in our final years, nothing could be more tragic.

Please advance courageously with the conviction that the more mistakes you make in your youth, the more you can build the foundation for a new chapter in your life and lifelong happiness.

It's also important as young people to have the guts and integrity to honestly admit your errors. Never be so cowardly as to refuse to admit your mistakes and instead blame them on others.

Being open-minded enough to calmly reflect and pinpoint where you went wrong can become the source of future value creation.

There is nothing more reassuring, refreshing, or beautiful than young people striving hard toward a goal. Nothing in all the world is more beautiful than the earnest struggles of youth.

From Watashi wa ko omou (My Thoughts), published in Japanese in May 1969.

Section 20.13: Work and Faith Are One and Inseparable

President Ikeda discusses the attitude with which young people should apply themselves at work as practitioners of Nichiren Buddhism.

Nichiren Daishonin writes: "Regard your service to your lord as the practice of the Lotus Sutra. This is what is meant by 'No worldly affairs of life or work are ever contrary to the true reality'" (WND-1, 905). In other words, we should treat our work as part of our Buddhist practice and recognize that all human affairs are manifestations of the Mystic Law.

Whatever your job, whatever your position, it is important that you, as a person who chants Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, bring forth wisdom and sincerely do your best to create value for the happiness of others and the welfare of society. All such efforts are part of your Buddhist practice to accumulate "treasures of the heart" (WND-1, 851). Your work and your Buddhist practice are not separate. Rather, your Buddhist practice and Soka Gakkai activities are the power source for making your work the most valuable and meaningful.

Challenging and polishing ourselves in accord with this passage from the Daishonin's writings is a proud Soka Gakkai tradition.

Many members in the early days of our movement faced harsh opposition to their Buddhist practice in the workplace. But taking to heart Mr. Toda's guidance—"In faith, do the work of one; in your job, do the work of three"—they strove to do their best both at work and in their Buddhist practice. Determined to show actual proof on the job, they chanted earnestly and made all-out efforts. Facing their difficulties head-on, they chanted daimoku with firm resolve, applied themselves with integrity, and worked harder than anyone.

A person's attitude toward work reflects their attitude toward life and other people; it reflects their beliefs about their purpose in living. The most profound, powerful, and sound philosophy for living is faith in Nichiren Buddhism.

Each of you has the supreme and unparalleled life purpose of realizing kosen-rufu, of creating world peace and happiness for all humanity. To do your best each day at work based on the great vow for kosen-rufu is the spirit to "regard your service to your lord as the practice of the Lotus Sutra" (WND-1, 905). As a young person striving to achieve this, the world's greatest vow, please chant with a strong and grand determination to become the best person in the world at your job and to make your workplace or your company the best in the world!

Faith is shown in your strength and ability as an individual. Therefore, please chant earnestly, study hard, exert yourself, be creative and enterprising, and throw all your youthful energy into your work. Doing so will bring you wonderful results. Even if things don't go the way you'd hoped, chant more daimoku, try again, and open up new horizons. That is exactly what I have done.

Knowing that I had received instruction and training from the best mentor in the world, I was resolved to be the best in the world at whatever job I did. And I chanted and exerted myself to demonstrate Mr. Toda's greatness through my work.

Remember that whether you win or lose in work and life doesn't depend upon the size of your company or the work environment. It all depends on you. It depends on your determination, your attitude.

Section 20.14: Those Who Are Strong Stand Alone

President Ikeda stresses that what is vital in youth is the courage to stand alone.

The German poet and playwright Friedrich von Schiller declared that the strong individual is strongest when acting alone.

I have treasured these words since my youth.

It is not good to blindly follow the crowd. Going along with something without any real thought, just because everyone is doing it, or being quite content with not having to make any decisions yourself, leads to mental laziness and apathy. And that's dangerous. When everyone says that war is good, everyone rushes to war, without dissent or opposition, even if they know it spells disaster. No one has the courage to stand up and bravely declare: "War is wrong!" They just go along with the current social climate and whatever appears to be popular at the time.

But we mustn't be led astray. We must never abandon our commitment to peace, our desire to learn, and our love for humanity. Putting those values into practice ourselves and encouraging others to share them, too, takes courage. Courage lies inside us. It is something we must rouse from within.

Mindlessly following the crowd is not courage, but cowardice. It's fascism, not democracy. In a democracy, we each have to recognize that we are society's protagonists and as such have a responsibility to fulfill. Instead, there's too much self-interest—the attitude that "so long as I'm happy, that's all that matters"—and too much blind following—the mentality that "it's safer to go along with what everyone else says."

Only when people have the courage to stand alone can they lead the world in the direction of peace and good. When such courageous individuals join forces and unite in strong solidarity, they can change society. But it all starts with you. You have to be courageous. The rest all follows from that.

Courage is inseparable from justice. It is the determination to do what's right, to build a just society, and to follow the correct path as a human being. It is doing good, taking positive action, not only for ourselves, but for humanity and the world as well. To do this, we need the indispensable power of courage. Our efforts may not call attention to themselves but, in reality, they shine with unsurpassed brilliance.

It takes courage to put a stop to bullying. It takes courage to endure hardships and survive tough circumstances. It takes amazing courage to lead good, productive lives, day after day. And it also takes tremendous courage to share our opinions with our families and friends so that everyone, ourselves included, can move in a more positive direction.

Those with the courage to do what is right, no matter what others say, possess a "precious sword" of limitless power. In Buddhism, such people are called bodhisattvas and Buddhas.

People of genuine courage have no underhanded motivations. They are straightforward and honest—which is why they are often misunderstood and even treated as villains. In contrast, there are others who are skillful manipulators, who scheme and self-promote to gain popularity. Many people are fooled by their apparent success, and even envy them.

However others may be, those who have done what is right—even if misunderstood, scorned, or harassed as a result—have a clear conscience. They are victors.

True courage is defined by whether it is motivated by justice and compassion. Mr. Toda used to say: "It's hard for us ordinary mortals to have compassion. Emotions get in the way, or we just can't be bothered. Though compassion is important, it's difficult for us. But we can have courage. Practically speaking, having courage is our way of acting with compassion."

And in fact, if we act with courage, we find that our compassion for others actually grows deeper. Courage is indeed the highest virtue.

Section 20.15: Personal Relationships

Responding to questions from high school students, President Ikeda discusses friendship and relationships from various perspectives.

Friendship is the most beautiful, powerful, and precious thing in life. It is your greatest treasure. No matter how successful or wealthy a person is, without friends, life is sad and lonely. A lack of friends can also lead to a narrow, self-centered existence.

In this vast universe, we have been born together at the same time on this tiny planet. And how rare is it to find, among the billions of members of the human race, truly caring and honest friends who understand our thoughts and feelings without the need for a lot of words and with whom we can relax and be ourselves.

Even being in the same class at school with someone is the result of a profound connection. Some of you may have found genuine friends among your classmates. If you have, please treasure them. But if you feel you don't have any close friends right now, please don't worry. Just decide that the reason you don't have any now is so you'll be able to make the most wonderful friends later on. Concentrate your energies now on becoming the best person you can. In the future, you might even make friends all over the world.

In any event, friendship is up to you, not the other person. It all depends on you. I hope you will be loyal and true friends, not fair-weather friends who are there when all is well, but disappear when something bad happens.

And when you graduate from school, I hope you will have grown to be generous, warmhearted people who can say to your friends with all honesty: "I will never forget you. If you ever have a problem or something you want to talk about, don't hesitate to come to me. And I hope I can go to you, too."

What kind of advice would you give someone who feels that a friend has suddenly started to treat them coldly, but has no idea why?

I think the best thing to do at such times is gather your courage and ask what's wrong. In many cases, you'll probably be surprised to find that what you imagined wasn't your friend's intention at all. Quite often, when you distance yourself from a friend because you're too afraid to ask what's wrong, the other person may in fact also be feeling hurt and lonely.

Human relationships are like a mirror. Often when you are thinking, "If my friend were only a bit nicer to me, I'd be more open with her," your friend may well be thinking, "If only she were more open with me, I'd be nicer to her."

That's why it's important to be the one who starts the conversation. If you still get a cold response, then you know that the problem lies with your friend, not with you.

Sometimes, there's nothing we can do about the way others feel. People's hearts change. What do you do when that happens? Adopt the attitude, "Though others may change, I never will." If you are treated coldly or someone lets you down, resolve not to do the same to others. Those who betray others' trust only hurt themselves, as if they are driving a spike into their own hearts, without even being aware of it.

Shakyamuni is described as a person who always made the effort to reach out and speak to others—something that you need to be strong in order to do.

There may be times in life when others let you down or disappoint you. Nichiren Daishonin was betrayed by many of his followers, even though he was the Buddha of the Latter Day of the Law. I've had people turn against me, too, people for whom I'd done a great deal. But I was never surprised at all; rather, it's something I came to expect.

At such times, you need to be brave. You haven't done anything wrong, so just go on living with self-confidence and assurance. Those who betray or bully others are in the wrong. They are to be pitied.

If a friend betrays your trust, just forge new friendships. Don't lose your trust in everyone just because someone has hurt you. If you don't trust anyone you may avoid being hurt or disappointed, but you'll become a closed, narrow person. In truth, those who have suffered deeply are able to be kinder to others. You have to be strong.

Be like the sun. Not all of the light of the sun falls on planets that will reflect it back. The sun's rays also spread out into empty space, seemingly wasted. Yet, the sun still goes on shining brightly.

You may find that those who reject the radiant light of your friendship will naturally fade out of your lives. But the more you shine your light, the more brilliant your own lives will become. Follow the path that you believe in, no matter what others think or do. If you remain constant and stay true to yourselves, others will definitely one day come to understand your sincere intent.

You are also fortunate in that you can chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo. I know of many people who suffered from bullying, but when they challenged their situations through earnestly chanting, they suddenly found one day that the bullying had stopped. Through chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo when you are suffering, you can quite naturally overcome that suffering, almost without being aware of it. Often it's only when you look back that you realize it.

I hope you will also chant for your friends. That is the greatest expression of friendship.

You may have friends who are sick, who cannot attend school, or are struggling to cope with problems at home. Whatever the case may be, the best thing you can do is to chant for them. Your prayers, like radio waves, though invisible, will definitely reach them.

It is also important to chant for those you don't like, find hard to get along with, or feel resentful toward. It may be difficult and perhaps even impossible for you to do so at first. But if you keep trying and chant for them, the situation will change. Perhaps you will change, or they will change. Either way, the situation will move in a more positive direction. Many people have experienced this firsthand. Above all, becoming a person who is able to chant for the happiness of such challenging individuals will be your greatest fortune.

The influence of friends is sometimes stronger than that of parents or anyone else. If you have good friends, friends who are trying to improve and develop themselves, you'll improve and grow, too. Andrew Carnegie, the American steel magnate, modestly attributed his success to having gathered around him people who were far more talented and capable than he. This was his philosophy of life. The only way to make good friends is to be a good friend yourself. Good people gather around other good people.

I hope you will be accepting and supportive of others. Please become people with hearts as broad as a great river, as wide as the ocean, and as vast as the blue sky. Wonderful friendships will unfold from such big hearts.

Section 20.16: Love as a Source of Growth

In a discussion with young people, President Ikeda explains that the ideal love relationship is one where both parties inspire each other to realize vibrant growth and develop as human beings.

Just as naturally as spring brings flowers and winter brings snow, youth is a time of awakening to feelings of love and attraction. This is one of the stages of life. You are entering a new period in your life, just as the sun marks a new day by rising brightly at dawn.

Everyone's concerns about love and relationships are different. It depends on your personality, your situation, and your environment. There is no one single approach that will solve everyone's problems. In addition, everyone is perfectly free to fall in love or be attracted to someone. Who you decide to go out with or have a relationship with is your own choice, and it's not really anyone else's business.

The only advice I would like to give you on this subject, as an older friend, is not to let your relationship make you lose sight of pursuing your all-important personal development.

The purpose of your studies and after-school activities, such as team sports and clubs, is to build a foundation for your life, to make you a strong person. Worries about your personality and your relations with friends are also nutrients for building a strong self.

The same is true of love. Love should help you grow as a person; it should invigorate you and help you realize your full potential. This is the basic premise. But as the saying "Love is blind" suggests, when people are in love, they often lose the ability to see themselves objectively.

If you allow your new relationship to worry your parents, to lead you into bad behavior, or to stop you from studying, then you and your partner are acting as negative influences on, or hindrances to, each other. Neither of you will be happy if you just end up hurting one another.

The question is: Does the person you like inspire you to work harder at your studies or distract you from them? Does their presence make you more determined to devote greater energies to after-school activities, be a better friend, a more thoughtful son or daughter? Do they inspire you to realize your future goals and work to achieve them? Or is that person your central focus, overshadowing all else, including your after-school activities, your friends and family, and even your goals for the future?

A relationship in which you both forget what you should be doing now, your goals and aims, is not good for either of you. A healthy relationship is one in which two people encourage each other to reach their respective goals while sharing each other's hopes and dreams. A relationship should be a source of inspiration, invigoration, and hope to live your lives to the fullest.

Dante Alighieri is one of the greatest poets who ever lived. His great love, Beatrice, was his inspiration in life. He loved her from the time he was a boy, and then happened to meet her again by chance when he was eighteen. He wrote of the deep emotion he felt on that occasion in his poem "La Vita Nuova" (The New Life). As Dante struggled to find a way to express his feelings for Beatrice, he invented a new poetic form. Beatrice opened the door of artistic creation for him.

But his love for Beatrice would never be requited. She married another man, and died young. Yet, Dante kept loving her. His love forged, elevated, and deepened his spirit into something more lofty and noble. In his lifework, The Divine Comedy, Beatrice is depicted as a gentle, benevolent being who guides him to heaven.

Of course, Dante lived in a different age and perhaps a different country from you. But I think there are many things to be learned from this great poet who stayed true to his own feelings, whether they were reciprocated or not, and transformed them into his guiding inspiration in life. I truly believe that love should be a positive impetus for our lives, the driving force for living with strength and courage.

Section 20.17: Guidance on Marriage

In The New Human Revolution, Shin'ichi Yamamoto (whose character represents President Ikeda) engages in a discussion with young people during a visit to Italy in June 1981 and shares some thoughts on the subject of marriage.

"Naturally, marriage is a personal choice," Shin'ichi said, "but it cannot be denied that young people often lack life experience and a certain degree of maturity. That's why it's important to seek advice from your parents and older people you know, so that when you finally marry, those who care about you will celebrate your decision.

"Marriage is a lifelong commitment to share each other's joys and sorrows. We never know what kind of destiny we may confront or what challenges lie ahead. For couples to overcome such obstacles, it is of course important for them to love and care for one another; but it is also important for them to advance with a common purpose based on a foundation of shared philosophy and core beliefs.

"When both partners practice Nichiren Buddhism, I hope they will strive to build a relationship of mutual support and inspiration in which both can polish their faith and character.

"If you get into a relationship that causes you to grow distant from the organization, lose your joy in faith, and stop growing and improving, only you will suffer."

Nichiren Buddhism gives us the power to ride out life's rough waves. The path to building indestructible happiness is found on the front lines of Soka Gakkai activities. Our dedicated efforts for kosen-rufu bring us precious good fortune, each step we take along the way enabling us to transform our karma and open the way to a life of happiness and joy. That's why Shin'ichi stressed to the youth that they must never allow the flame of their faith to go out.

"In recent years," Shin'ichi continued, "there seems to be a global trend toward marriages ending quickly in divorce.

"But when someone who is practicing Nichiren Buddhism faces marital problems, I believe that, if they keep exerting themselves strongly in their practice, make a fresh determination in faith, and try hard to find a solution with their partner, they can, in many cases, wisely overcome their difficulties. The key, at any rate, is to have firm faith.

"The purpose of our Buddhist practice is to lead good lives, become happy, and illuminate society with the light of hope.

"To that end, please nurture loving relationships as couples, create fine families, win the trust and respect of those around you, and be people who demonstrate the greatness of Nichiren Buddhism."

From The New Human Revolution, vol. 30, "Bells of Dawn" chapter.

Section 20.18: "Learning Is Light, Ignorance Is Darkness"

Those who keep learning throughout life remain youthful. President Ikeda discusses the importance of cultivating the habit of learning while we are young.

There is a Russian saying: "Learning is light, ignorance is darkness." Of course, "learning" here does not refer only to studying at a university. In a broader sense, learning is self-improvement, while ignorance is stagnation. The spirit of learning leads to peace, progress, and prosperity, while ignorance leads to misery, misfortune, and impoverishment.

In my youth, I studied while working. Around 1950, when Mr. Toda's businesses were in serious trouble, was the most difficult period for me, as I was also in poor health. Yet, I never felt unhappy. Spending my days working alongside the person I had chosen as my mentor, I hadn't the slightest regret. My only frustration was that I couldn't study as much as I wanted to.

As if he knew my thoughts, Mr. Toda said to me: "Don't worry. I will teach you everything you would learn at a university. Just be patient. Leave your education to me."

From that time, I spent every Sunday at Mr. Toda's home, receiving private instruction from him. With his wide-ranging scholarship, which encompassed government, economics, literature, physics, astronomy, and other fields of science, he became a perfect tutor, imparting to me all of the knowledge he had acquired in his lifetime.

Eventually, in addition to Sundays, the classes expanded to weekday mornings before work. Mr. Toda's classes were extremely demanding. Through this training by my mentor in the midst of our arduous struggles, I built the foundation for my life.

Mr. Toda was always studying. Two weeks before he died, he sternly asked me what I had been reading, adding: "Never forget to keep reading. I'm presently up to volume three of the ancient Chinese classic Compendium of Eighteen Histories." At that time, he was extremely weak, to the extent that he could no longer stand or walk unaided. The intense resonance of his voice, however, still reverberates in my ears.

Those who continue learning, who stay active and engaged, remain forever young. Lives that continue improving are like the water of a ceaselessly flowing river, always fresh and pure.

Of the many people I have met, it was the eminent British historian Arnold J. Toynbee who impressed me most deeply with his unwavering devotion to learning.

After repeated invitations from Professor Toynbee, I had the opportunity to meet and engage in discussion with him for a total of forty hours over ten days in 1972 and 1973. The content of our dialogue was published in 1975. Since then it has been translated into English under the title of Choose Life, as well as into French, German, and many other languages, and been well received around the world. I am delighted at the result, hoping it might repay in some small way the sincerity of Professor Toynbee, who took the time to engage in those lengthy discussions with me, someone many years his junior.

The year after our dialogue ended, Professor Toynbee was incapacitated by illness. Unfortunately, the outlook for his recovery was not good, and it appears that he never fully regained his faculties. In a letter I received from his wife, Veronica, she wrote that even in that condition her husband asked for books, and although it was doubtful that he could actually read, he turned the pages as if he could.

I was deeply moved by this. Even when illness deprived him of his full awareness, Professor Toynbee's dedicated efforts in scholarly research had become an expression of his life itself, always seeking to learn and aiming higher. I felt he was the model of a great individual, who fully deserved of the recognition he had gained as one of the leading thinkers of the 20th century.

It is easy to pay lip service to lifelong learning. With Japan's emergence as an economic superpower, its people have more free time. They engage in a wide range of hobbies. But simply having the time and attending classes somewhere won't guarantee inner enrichment. The key is whether one has a vibrant desire to improve and grow.

Professor Toynbee kept books beside him even when he was bedridden. Learning had become a habit, a good habit, for him. Those who acquire that habit when they are young are fortunate.

In the workplace and the home, as well as in the events of daily life, we can always find precious opportunities to learn. There are those who use five spare minutes to read a newspaper, open a book, listen to the news, or gain something from an encounter with another person. Though they may seem busy, such people are able to transform that very busyness into learning. Laziness is the first step toward stagnation. Let us lead lives nourished by the rich wellspring of a love of learning, maintaining a lively interest and curiosity about everything.

Section 20.19: Be Suns Illuminating a New World

President Ikeda offers advice to SGI-USA youth division members on life and faith.

Youth is a time full of worries and problems. Young people's hearts are constantly vacillating. You are worried about your future, your personality, relationships, social issues, and life in general. You are confused and anxious. You are troubled by the gap between ideals and reality, and may sometimes fall into self-hatred and become consumed with insecurity and fear.

Youth is a season of emotional turmoil and suffering. This is the reality of youth, no matter what the country. In a certain sense, that's how it should be. You are not the only ones suffering like this, and in this period of change and growth, these feelings probably can't be helped.

The important thing is not to be impatient. You can't attain peace of mind nor social stability all at once. It takes time.

If a plane tries to take off without taxiing down the runway and gradually building up speed, it won't succeed. And even if it takes off, if it lacks sufficient fuel and good maintenance, it won't stay in the air long. It may even crash.

Life and Buddhist practice are like a marathon. You may at times run out front and at times fall behind. But what matters is the final moment at the finish line.

The training you undergo in your youth is all for that final, true victory. That's why you need to study as hard as you can now. Keep chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo and build up a reservoir of life force.

Steadily move ahead on the fundamental path of putting your faith into practice in life, in your own distinct way.

The sun rises every day. It never takes a break. If you do the same, persistently forging ahead in accord with the Mystic Law, the ultimate law of the universe, you will come to enjoy a wonderful life of complete satisfaction and fulfillment, far surpassing anything you imagined. Please be assured that this is the most certain and valuable way to spend your youth.

We are pioneers embracing this great philosophy, of which so much of humankind is still unaware. It is, therefore, extremely important to demonstrate just how wonderful Nichiren Buddhism truly is by showing actual proof of its benefit in our lives. Seeing such proof will enable people to realize the greatness and originality of this Buddhism and see that it is different from anything they have encountered before.

Nichiren Daishonin writes: "Even more valuable than reason and documentary proof is the proof of actual fact" (WND-1, 599).

Of course, you shouldn't overreach yourselves just trying to show proof. All you need do is present an example of steadily seeking to improve and develop yourselves in the way most natural for you—in your daily lives, in your families, your workplaces, your communities, and in your character.

Just carry out your human revolution in your own way. In doing so, you will naturally come to impress others with your vitality, hope, conviction, and reassuring presence. That, in itself, will build the foundation for sharing Nichiren Buddhism with others, without any need for words.

There's no need to rush in our efforts to share Buddhism. I feel it's better to be strict and uphold sound standards for membership, rather than just increase our numbers.

All people have a fabulous "new world"—a yet-undiscovered-realm—within them. It is called the world of Buddhahood. But most of humanity is still not aware of its existence.

Our Buddhist practice is the effort to fully tap and activate this "new world" of Buddhahood, a realm of infinite power and potential.

Once we awaken to the world of Buddhahood within us, our lives are filled with unsurpassed joy. An entirely "new world" also opens up in our lives and in society. Communicating this to others is our mission.

From a speech at an SGI-USA youth training session, U.S.A., February 26, 1990.

Section 20.20: Cherish High Ideals

Through the guidance of second Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda, President Ikeda calls on young people to strive with all their might to realize high ideals.

Naturally, there are many different ways to live your youth, and there is no need to suggest a single approach for everyone. But whatever path you choose, what will play a decisive role in the direction your life takes into the future is whether you live the days of your youth to the fullest or let them slip by without making any real effort.

President Toda often gave us guidance to the effect: "If you're going to do something big, it's important that you have the determination to achieve it in your 20s and 30s. If you wait until you're in your forties, and then suddenly decide to embark on some great venture, it becomes that much more difficult to succeed."

He also advised: "Young people should cherish dreams that seem almost too big to accomplish. Inevitably in life, we're only able to achieve a fraction of what we'd like to. So if your dreams are too small to begin with, you'll end up not being able to accomplish anything. What good, then, will you have created with your life?"

Striving to realize a high ideal in your twenties and thirties is the key to enjoying unsurpassed satisfaction and fulfillment in this seemingly long yet short existence.

You're only young once. How unfortunate it would be to reach your forties and fifties and be filled with sadness and regret. A life of discontent—a life unfulfilled and half-realized like a sputtering, smoldering fire that never leaps into bright flames—is also a terrible waste.

That's why you should burn your brightest and strive your hardest in your youth when you are at the height of your powers and your health. It is all for your own benefit.

Mr. Toda taught that young people should cherish high ideals and advance with bright, burning energy. The higher the summit you aim for, the greater the satisfaction you will savor when you reach the peak. This is a way of life filled with passion and growth, brimming with the limitless power of faith in the Mystic Law.

Kosen-rufu is the supreme summit for humankind, the most meaningful and noble ideal. It is also the most realistic ideal, and one that is most urgently needed by society and the times. Dedicate your youth and your life, fully and without reservation, to the great ideal of kosen-rufu. Such a life accords with the teachings of Nichiren Daishonin and embodies the essence of the unchanging Soka Gakkai spirit.

From a speech at a Soka Gakkai Headquarters leaders meeting, Tokyo, January 20, 1988.

Section 20.21: Ushering in a New Dawn of Human Rights

On the anniversary of March 16—Kosen-rufu Day—in 1991, President Ikeda sent a message to the youth division. He spoke of Nichiren Daishonin's powerful declaration for human rights and called on the youth to continue that noble struggle.

I have here with me a book published by UNESCO to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1968. Titled Birthright of Man, it is a compilation of quotes on human rights from individuals around the world, past and present. The words of Nichiren Daishonin are included, a passage that appears in "The Selection of the Time." It is his defiant declaration to the de facto ruler of the time, Hei no Saemon-no-jo, after returning to Kamakura from exile on Sado Island: "Even if it seems that, because I was born in the ruler's domain, I follow him in my actions, I will never follow him in my heart" (WND-1, 579).

The Daishonin is saying: "You are the ruling authority. You have the power to send me into exile and then grant me my freedom. But you do not have the power to control my heart. I will never be a slave to you or anyone else in power."

His declaration encapsulates a core tenet of his life.

The Daishonin spent his entire life fighting against despotism, armed solely with the power of the spirit and the power of reason. His words from "The Selection of the Time" keenly convey his self-confidence and conviction: "You may be a king in the political realm, but I am king in the spiritual realm."

As I contemplate these words, the lion's roar of my mentor, Josei Toda, also echoes in my heart—his proud declaration at the ceremony of March 16, 1958, that "the Soka Gakkai is the king of the religious world."

That declaration inspired his disciples to action. We strove day and night, until the Daishonin's words, after 700 years, began to illuminate the entire world.

Under the brilliant sunlight of this reality, all insinuations and intrigues against our organization are as fleeting as dew.

In the UNESCO publication, the Daishonin's words appear in a chapter titled "Limitations on Power."

Even the greatest worldly power cannot enslave the human spirit, stifle cries of freedom, or destroy justice. And above all, it cannot hide the truth for long.

This book is just one example of how people around the world see Nichiren Daishonin's life as a struggle for human rights, recognizing and praising him as a great pioneer in advocating that cause.

We of the Soka Gakkai are carrying on the Daishonin's struggle in modern times and are advancing it around the world as a great people's movement.

In Japan, there has never before been such a substantial grassroots struggle for human rights. Perhaps for that reason, the Japanese are only dimly aware of the importance of human rights. That makes it hard for them to grasp our movement's noble significance.

Those insensitive to human rights find it easy to violate them. In the end, they may discover that their own human rights have been taken away. We must not allow the arrival of such a terrible age; we must usher in a new dawn of human rights. That is the mission of youth. That is your mission.

From a message commemorating March 16, Kosen-rufu Day, published in the Seikyo Shimbun, March 16, 1991.

Note on reference: The UNESCO book Birthright of Man: A Selection of Texts, edited by Jeanne Hersch, was published in 1969, page 127. This book featured an earlier translation of the passage that read: "Having the honour to be born in your kingdom, I find my body obeying your Excellency, but my soul will never."
