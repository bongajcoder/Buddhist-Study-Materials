Chapter 5: Three Thousand Realms in a Single Moment of Life

"Three thousand realms in a single moment of life" is a Buddhist teaching revealing how ordinary people can attain buddhahood. Studying this deepens understanding of how Nichiren Buddhism enables all people to achieve enlightenment.

Section 1: Three Thousand Realms in a Single Moment of Life

One philosophical principle underlying Nichiren Daishonin's inscription of the Gohonzon is the doctrine of three thousand realms in a single moment of life. Great Teacher Tiantai formulated this in his work Great Concentration and Insight to help people practice the Lotus Sutra's teaching that all can attain buddhahood.

"A single moment of life" indicates one's life at any given moment. "Three thousand realms" refers to all phenomena and their varied functions. The principle teaches that a single moment of life includes three thousand realms, with life at each moment pervading all of them.

Life at each moment contains limitless potential. Transforming one's life state at this moment changes the surrounding environment, potentially transforming the entire world. Thus this doctrine represents a teaching of hope and transformation. President Ikeda describes this in his novel The Human Revolution: "A great human revolution in just a single individual will help achieve a change in the destiny of a nation."

Nichiren Daishonin quotes Tiantai's work: "Life at each moment is endowed with the Ten Worlds. Each of the Ten Worlds is endowed with all Ten Worlds, so an entity of life actually possesses one hundred worlds."

The Mutual Possession of the Ten Worlds

The core principle is the mutual possession of the Ten Worlds. Daishonin writes: "The doctrine of three thousand realms in a single moment of life begins with the concept of the mutual possession of the Ten Worlds."

The Ten Worlds represent ten states of life: first, hell; second, hungry spirits; third, animals; fourth, asuras; fifth, human beings; sixth, heavenly beings; seventh, voice-hearers; eighth, cause-awakened ones; ninth, bodhisattvas; and tenth, buddhas.

Sutras other than the Lotus Sutra teach that each world is distinct and separate. But the Lotus Sutra reveals that all people in any of the nine worlds possess the world of buddhahood, and buddhahood contains all nine worlds.

The mutual possession means a life manifesting any one of the Ten Worlds possesses all of them. Buddhas and all people are essentially equal. If life displays a particular world at this moment, it potentially manifests another world the next moment. Anyone in any world can, with proper conditions, manifest buddhahood and become a buddha.

This principle explains that one can elevate one's life state to that of bodhisattvas and even buddhahood within this lifetime.

The Ten Factors of Life

Ten aspects are common to all life in any of the Ten Worlds. All lives equally possess the ten factors of life, describing the law of causality behind changes in one's life state.

The "Expedient Means" chapter of the Lotus Sutra describes the "true aspect of all phenomena" as consisting of: "appearance, nature, entity, power, influence, internal cause, relation, latent effect, manifest effect, and their consistency from beginning to end."

Appearance is the outward form subject to change moment to moment.

Nature is the innate, consistent character or intrinsic attributes.

Entity is the being itself, having aspects of appearance and nature.

These three constitute the existence and essence of the living being. The remaining seven express life's workings or functions.

Power means internal energy or inner potential.

Influence is the outward expression of power and its effect on other life or phenomena.

Internal cause is a primary cause inherent in life producing an effect.

Relation refers to external conditions stimulating the internal cause.

Latent effect is the intrinsic, imperceptible result from interaction of internal cause and relation.

Manifest effect is the evident result emerging from the latent effect.

Consistency from beginning to end means all factors remain consistent through all Ten Worlds.

Life in any world equally possesses the ten factors and the law of causality governing life changes. While displaying one world, life potentially manifests any other in response to conditions. Anyone can, with proper conditions, manifest buddhahood.

The Three Realms of Existence

The three realms of existence are: the realm of the five components, the realm of living beings, and the realm of the environment. Each of the Ten Worlds distinctly expresses itself in these three realms.

Living beings are classified according to their life states - the Ten Worlds - from moment to moment. The realm of living beings reflects these differences.

Buddhism regards living beings as temporary unions of five components with no fixed permanent existence, constantly changing. Changes in the life state of living beings are evident in these five components.

The five components are: form, meaning the physical body and attributes; perception, meaning receiving sensory information; conception, meaning forming impressions about perceptions; volition, meaning linking perception to action; and consciousness, meaning the discerning function recognizing and distinguishing things.

In hell, the five components have characteristics specific to hell; in buddhahood, characteristics specific to buddhahood. Thus the realm of the five components manifests the Ten Worlds.

The differences in life states are also manifest in the environment inhabitants occupy. The realm of the environment reflects which world is manifested.

When the state of the five components changes, those of living beings and their environments also change. A change in one's heart and mind effects changes in all aspects of one's life and environment.

These three principles - mutual possession of the Ten Worlds, ten factors of life, and three realms of existence - merged together form the three thousand realms in a single moment of life. This teaching provides a comprehensive view of causality permeating life and the world, clarifying that all people are equally capable of attaining buddhahood.
