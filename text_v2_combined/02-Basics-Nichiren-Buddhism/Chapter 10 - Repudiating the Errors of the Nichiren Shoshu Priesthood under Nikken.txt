Chapter 10: Repudiating the Errors of the Nichiren Shoshu Priesthood under Nikken

Since its establishment, the Soka Gakkai has grounded itself completely on faith that is directly connected to Nichiren Daishonin. It has consistently taken action to spread the Daishonin's Buddhist teachings to create happiness for all people and bring about world peace.

However, a group emerged that sought to destroy this movement for kosen-rufu, and in doing so that group, known as the Nikken sect, revealed its true nature as a devilish function.

The Nikken sect refers to the priesthood of the Nichiren Shoshu Buddhist school in its corrupt state since the tenure of Nikken Abe, who lived from 1922 to 2019, and who claimed to be the sixty-seventh in the lineage of its high priests. This sect has taken the position that its high priest, who is also its chief administrator, possesses absolute and uncontestable authority and power.

In the three decades since instigating what has become known as the Second Priesthood Issue in 1990, the Nikken sect has betrayed the teachings and spirit of Nichiren Buddhism and has become a group given over to slander of the Buddhist Law.

Though Nikken transferred the office of high priest to Nichinyo in December 2005, the lineage he passed on continues to be muddied by his slander of the Law.

Section 1: The Battle against Evil Functions

In his treatise "On Establishing the Correct Teaching for the Peace of the Land," Nichiren Daishonin emphasizes that practitioners must wage continuous battle against negative influences that delude people and lead them astray.

Speaking Out against the "Enemies of the Lotus Sutra"

Nichiren Buddhism emphasizes that admonishing and striving against evil is an important element of faith. The concept of "enemies of the Lotus Sutra" refers to those who encourage people to abandon the Lotus Sutra and thereby close off the path to buddhahood for all people.

The Lotus Sutra teaches that the buddha nature exists in the life of every person, expressing the most universal ideal of respect for all human beings. To deny or deprecate the sutra, to impede its spread, or to oppress practitioners of the sutra is to oppose the ideals of respect for the dignity of life, equality of all people, and the primacy of ordinary people.

Ryokan of Gokurakuji temple exemplifies such an enemy during the Daishonin's lifetime. While outwardly revered as a living buddha, he covertly harbored animosity toward the Daishonin and conspired to have him persecuted. In contemporary times, Nikken fulfilled this role by scheming to destroy the Soka Gakkai, the organization working to accomplish the Daishonin's will.

An Overview of the Priesthood Issue

The Daishonin's spirit and practice for kosen-rufu was correctly inherited by his disciple Nikko Shonin. However, this spirit gradually waned within the Nichiren Shoshu priesthood, giving way to hollow formality and ritual. Priests adopted an increasingly authoritarian posture and discriminatory attitude toward lay believers.

By the time the Soka Gakkai was established, correct understanding and practice of the Daishonin's teachings had been nearly lost within the priesthood.

After World War II, when the priesthood faced severe economic problems, the Soka Gakkai earnestly supported it and built and donated more than 350 temples. However, elements within the priesthood refused to acknowledge this support, and friction arose with priests intent on maintaining their religious authority.

After Nikken took office as high priest, the priesthood's authoritarian stance intensified. Regarding President Ikeda and the Soka Gakkai, Nikken plotted their destruction through "Operation C," with "C" meaning to "cut" the Soka Gakkai, which commenced in December 1990 with a sudden rule revision dismissing President Ikeda from his lay representative position.

The Soka Gakkai sought dialogue, but the priesthood refused. On November 7, 1991, the priesthood sent a "Remonstrance to Disband" document, followed on November 28 by a "Notice of Excommunication." The priesthood cruelly refused to confer the Gohonzon upon Soka Gakkai members, attempting to coerce believers into submission by withholding this fundamental object of devotion.

In 1993, the Soka Gakkai decided to confer upon its members a Gohonzon transcribed by Nichikan Shonin, made possible through cooperation with a temple opposing Nikken. The Soka Gakkai became the global organization qualified to confer the Gohonzon in accord with Nichiren Daishonin's spirit.

In 1998, the Nikken sect demolished the Sho-Hondo, the Grand Main Temple, at Taisekiji, an edifice built in 1972 through the sincere faith and contributions of approximately eight million people. Constructed to last one thousand years and hailed as a twentieth-century architectural masterpiece, it was heartlessly demolished just twenty-six years after completion, disregarding the sincere faith of millions of believers.

Section 2: The Major Offenses and Erroneous Doctrines of the Nikken Sect

Core to the Nikken sect is a deluded belief venerating its high priest as a special, absolute, and infallible being - a doctrine called high priest worship. This belief rests on the premise that a mysterious heritage or lineage exists exclusively between successive high priests, bolstering the priesthood's tendency to look down on lay believers.

Nothing in Nichiren Daishonin's writings justifies or supports this view, constituting a false doctrine starkly opposed to authentic Nichiren Buddhism.

The Slander of Attempting to Destroy Kosen-rufu

The Nikken sect implemented Operation C to destroy the Soka Gakkai, the organization dedicated to kosen-rufu, and sent the excommunication notice in 1991. This document cited no passages from Nichiren Daishonin's writings and expressed no doctrinal basis for the excommunication. It simply repeated authoritarian assertions that the Soka Gakkai was not obediently following the priesthood.

The task of achieving kosen-rufu is the legacy left by Nichiren Daishonin. The Daishonin declares, "The 'great vow' refers to the propagation of the Lotus Sutra" and emphasizes unified effort toward this widespread propagation goal.

Since its founding, the Soka Gakkai has aimed to accomplish kosen-rufu, exerting itself in propagating Nichiren Buddhism worldwide. To attempt to destroy the Soka Gakkai is to attempt to destroy kosen-rufu itself - a grave slander of the Buddhist Law and betrayal of the Daishonin's spirit.

Nikken's Grave Offense of Causing Disunity in the Buddhist Order

Buddhist teachings describe five cardinal sins: killing one's father, killing one's mother, killing an arhat, injuring a buddha, and causing disunity in the Buddhist Order. Among these, causing disunity in the Buddhist Order - creating disruption and division among Buddhist practitioners - is extremely serious as it destroys Buddha's teachings and deludes people, causing unhappiness. This represents Nikken's gravest offense.

The False Doctrine of Worship of the High Priest

The Nikken sect's doctrine holds that the high priest should be regarded as an object of worship or veneration. However, a high priest should be responsible for protecting, teaching, and spreading Buddhist teachings, serving as a model for faith, practice, study, and upholding correct doctrine.

Since the second priesthood issue, Nikken consistently claimed that because the high priest is infallible and an object of worship, one must follow him without question. This doctrine violates the three treasures - the Buddha, the Law meaning the Buddha's teachings, and the Buddhist Order - of Nichiren Buddhism.

A Nichiren Shoshu publication document states that the high priest to whom the heritage of the Law has been transmitted is inseparable with the Dai-Gohonzon and that faith in both must be absolute. In authentic Nichiren Buddhism, however, there is just one object of devotion: the Gohonzon. The Nikken sect's erroneous doctrine places the high priest on equal par with the Gohonzon - an unprecedented distortion.

Correct Faith Means Basing Oneself on the Gohonzon

Since the time of the Daishonin and Nikko Shonin, correct faith has been defined as faith based upon the Gohonzon. The Daishonin instructs followers to "Believe in this mandala with all your heart." He emphasizes that disciples believe solely in the Lotus Sutra and can thereby enter the treasure tower of the Gohonzon.

Nikko Shonin states that the five characters of Myoho-renge-kyo should be the object of devotion - the object inscribed in the Daishonin's own hand.

The Error of Regarding the High Priest as Infallible

In "Nikko yuikai okibumi," known as The Twenty-Six Admonitions of Nikko, Nikko Shonin warns: "Do not follow even the high priest if he goes against the Buddha's Law and propounds his own views." This warning acknowledged the possibility that future school heads might commit serious errors.

Nikko Shonin further noted that if a high priest or senior priest should deviate from principles or commit a prohibited act, he should be allowed to renew his practice among priests of ordinary rank while pursuing reflection and contrition, rather than being expelled.

From these admonitions, it is clear that the Nikken sect's view of high priest infallibility is completely misguided and violates the teachings of both the Daishonin and Nikko Shonin.

A Mistaken View of Heritage

Heritage or lineage in Nichiren Buddhism has always been open to all people, not the exclusive possession of an elite few. However, Nikken held an erroneous view of heritage.

This view proposes that a mysterious heritage or lineage exists exclusively between successive high priests, and that receiving this lineage alone grants exclusive inheritance of the Buddha's enlightenment and the essence of the Buddha's Law.

The Nikken sect's mysterious transmission concept bears no relation to the Daishonin or Nikko Shonin's teachings and amounts to a falsehood concocted to bolster high priest status and authority.

The True Meaning of Heritage Is Faith That Is Open to All People

In the Buddhist world of Nichiren Daishonin's time, heritage meant passing on deepest Buddhist teachings to a select group through secret transmission, following practices common in esoteric True Word school and Tendai or Zen schools.

In contrast, the Daishonin states in "The Heritage of the Ultimate Law of Life": "Nichiren has been trying to awaken all the people of Japan to faith in the Lotus Sutra so that they, too, can share the heritage and attain buddhahood."

In authentic Nichiren Buddhism, heritage is ultimately described as "heritage of faith" - that is, as faith itself.

The Nikken sect claims a mysterious, exclusive heritage that automatically makes one a buddha upon receipt, regardless of faith or practice. This departs fundamentally from the heritage of faith taught by the Daishonin.

Discriminatory Attitude toward the Laity

The Nichiren Shoshu priesthood, from Nikken onward, adopts a discriminatory attitude toward lay believers, regarding priests as superior and laity as inferior. No teaching or principle within Nichiren Buddhism justifies such disrespect or contempt toward laypeople.

Conversely, the Daishonin confirmed clergy-laity equality, stating that the Buddha considers anyone embracing the Lotus Sutra - whether layman or laywoman, monk or nun - to be the lord of all living beings. Additionally, anyone teaching even a single phrase of the Lotus Sutra, whether priest or layman, nun or laywoman, is the envoy of the Thus Come One.

The priesthood's denial of clergy-laity equality stems from Buddhism's degradation in Japan, particularly during the Edo period from 1603 to 1867, when it became known as funeral Buddhism. The temple parishioner system resulted in priests controlling lay believers and forcing them into servile positions, while lay believers came to depend entirely on priests rather than practicing independently.

These harmful tendencies remain deeply ingrained in the Nikken sect, resulting in the belief that priests are superior to laity.

Misuse of Religious Rituals

A major error of the Nikken sect is misusing Buddhist rituals and ceremonies as means for making money - including funeral and memorial services, bestowal of posthumous Buddhist names, and issuing of wooden memorial tablets for graves.

These rituals were not instituted by the Daishonin but became established later. The Nikken sect asserts that unless a priest conducts a funeral service, the deceased cannot attain buddhahood - a claim the Daishonin never taught.

Rather, the Daishonin encouraged those who had lost loved ones, stating that because their beloved departed father chanted Nam-myoho-renge-kyo while alive, he was a person who attained buddhahood in his present form. He stressed that attaining buddhahood depends on one's own faith and practice while alive.

Therefore, ignoring the Daishonin's guidance and asserting that the deceased cannot attain buddhahood without priestly funeral rites constitutes distorting the Daishonin's teachings.

Corruption and Immorality

The Daishonin states: "True priests are those who are honest and who desire little and yet know satisfaction." The Nikken sect priests, beginning with Nikken himself, have behaved in corrupt and self-indulgent manner in stark violation of this instruction. The Daishonin compared such irresponsible priests using Buddhism for selfish gain to "an animal dressed in priestly robes" or to "Law-devouring hungry spirits."

Section 3: Spiritual Independence

November 28, 1991, marked the Soka Gakkai's excommunication from the Nichiren Shoshu. For Soka Gakkai members, however, this date marks their achievement of spiritual independence. Freeing themselves from the corrupt priesthood's chains, members have emerged globally, embracing their mission to achieve kosen-rufu. Their numbers have steadily grown, and today they are active in 192 countries and territories worldwide.

The Nikken sect has continued declining; its current membership represents merely two percent of what existed before excommunicating the Soka Gakkai.

By striving to achieve the Daishonin's will for kosen-rufu, the Soka Gakkai has succeeded to authentic Nichiren Buddhism's heritage. Resolutely challenging and refuting the Nikken sect's false and destructive actions, Soka Gakkai members continue opening pathways for expanding kosen-rufu throughout the world.
