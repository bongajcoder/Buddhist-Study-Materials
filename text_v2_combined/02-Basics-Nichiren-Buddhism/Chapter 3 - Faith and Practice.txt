Chapter 3: Faith and Practice

Section 1: Three Proofs

The three proofs represent criteria for identifying correct Buddhist teaching. They are documentary proof, which means doctrines based on foundational scriptures; theoretical proof, which means compatibility with reason and logic; and actual proof, which means positive results in people's lives and society.

Nichiren Daishonin emphasized that "the best standards are those of reason and documentary proof. And even more valuable than reason and documentary proof is the proof of actual fact." Actual proof holds primacy because Buddhism's fundamental aim is enabling human happiness.

Section 2: Faith, Practice, and Study

Correct Nichiren Buddhist practice requires three interconnected elements:

Faith means believing in Nichiren Daishonin's teaching and the Gohonzon as the supreme object of devotion. Faith serves as the foundation for attaining buddhahood.

Practice comprises concrete efforts transforming our lives through two aspects: practice for ourselves, which is for personal benefit, and practice for others, which means teaching Buddhism to enable others' enlightenment. The Daishonin stated that "Nam-myoho-renge-kyo encompasses both practice for oneself and the teaching of others."

Daily gongyo - reciting Lotus Sutra excerpts and chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo - polishes and strengthens our lives. Spreading Buddhist teachings, even briefly, represents equally important practice for others.

Study involves learning Nichiren Daishonin's writings and Buddhist principles. President Toda observed: "Faith seeks understanding, and understanding deepens faith." Study prevents personal misinterpretation and guards against false teachings.

Section 3: Faith for Overcoming Obstacles

The Three Obstacles and Four Devils

As practice deepens, obstacles inevitably emerge. The three obstacles are:

First, the obstacle of earthly desires: Greed, anger, and foolishness impeding practice.

Second, the obstacle of karma: Hindrances from those close to us.

Third, the obstacle of retribution: Impediments from difficult circumstances or those with authority over us.

The four devils represent devilish workings that undermine practitioners:

First, the hindrance of the five components, meaning disharmony in body and mind.

Second, the hindrance of earthly desires, meaning afflictions destroying faith.

Third, the hindrance of death, meaning practice interrupted or faith wavered by death.

Fourth, the hindrance of the devil king, meaning the fundamental devilish function from innate delusion.

The Daishonin taught that when obstacles appear, "the wise will rejoice while the foolish will retreat." Strong faith transforms obstacles into opportunities for advancement.

The Three Powerful Enemies

The Lotus Sutra describes three categories of opponents persecuting Latter Day practitioners:

First, arrogant laypeople: Ignorant of Buddhism, they slander and attack practitioners.

Second, arrogant monks: Flawed Buddhist clergy with crooked hearts who harass correct practitioners.

Third, arrogant false sages: Seemingly respectable monks who deceive through false claims to authorities.

The third category proves most formidable due to their concealed nature and high status.

Section 4: Changing One's Karma

Transforming Karma

Buddhism explains karma as actions from past lives creating present circumstances. However, Nichiren Daishonin revealed that practitioners can transform karma in this lifetime by replacing evil causes with good ones.

The Daishonin taught that slandering the Lotus Sutra represents ultimate evil, while believing and spreading it constitutes ultimate good. By chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo with faith, practitioners manifest buddhahood within, causing negative karma to "vanish like frost or dew in the sunlight."

Lessening Karmic Retribution

Heavy karma creating major suffering across lifetimes can be experienced in diminished form in a single lifetime through Buddhist practice. The Daishonin stated: "The sufferings of hell will vanish instantly" upon eliminating evil karma.

Hardships become opportunities for purification, enabling practitioners to forge stronger lives.

Voluntarily Assuming Appropriate Karma

The Lotus Sutra teaches that bodhisattvas voluntarily relinquish rewards from pure deeds to be born into impure worlds, choosing suffering from compassion to save others.

Practitioners can transform karma into mission, reframing hardship as opportunity to inspire others. President Ikeda observed: "When we change our karma into mission, we transform our destiny from playing a negative role to a positive one."

Section 5: Faith Equals Daily Life

Causality of Benefit and Loss

Believing in Nam-myoho-renge-kyo generates consistent benefit - the ultimate being buddhahood's establishment. Practitioners "purify the six sense organs," meaning eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind, manifesting wisdom, serenity, and joy while overcoming difficulties.

Those slandering correct teaching experience loss as natural consequences, serving as warnings to redirect toward Buddhist practice.

Heavenly Gods and Benevolent Deities

These protective functions support correct practitioners. The Daishonin taught: "The protection of the gods depends on the strength of one's faith." Environmental and social forces naturally protect those practicing the Mystic Law.

Many in Body, One in Mind

This essential unity principle means individuals maintain distinctive qualities and talents, which is the "many in body" aspect, while sharing identical purpose and faith, which is the "one in mind" aspect, towards kosen-rufu - worldwide peace through Buddhism's spread.

The Daishonin affirmed: "If the spirit of many in body but one in mind prevails among the people, they will achieve all their goals."

Faith Equals Daily Life

The Daishonin stated: "Regard your service to your lord as the practice of the Lotus Sutra." Daily responsibilities in work, business, and society constitute Buddhism's actual practice venue.

Faith provides roots enabling stable, secure lives. Mundane challenges become stages for manifesting inner buddhahood through earnest effort based on chanting daimoku.

One's Behavior as a Human Being

Buddhism teaches full humanity development as true victory. The Daishonin wrote: "The purpose of the appearance in this world of Shakyamuni Buddha... lies in his behavior as a human being."

Practitioners demonstrate faith's power through trustworthy conduct, good character, and respect for others' inherent buddha nature. This spirit - cherishing all people, opposing discrimination, and spreading goodness - constitutes Buddhism's essence and produces clear life victory.
