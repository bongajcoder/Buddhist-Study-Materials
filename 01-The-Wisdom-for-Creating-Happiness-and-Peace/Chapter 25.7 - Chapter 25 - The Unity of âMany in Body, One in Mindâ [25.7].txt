Chapter 25: The Unity of âMany in Body, One in Mindâ [25.7]

25.7 âOne in Mindâ Means Sharing an Unwavering Commitment in Faith

Citing the guidance of second Soka Gakkai president Josei Toda, President Ikeda explains the profound meaning of âmany in body, one in mind.â

Mr. Toda said: âThe âmindâ of âmany in body, one in mindâ is not the ordinary mind, or heart. It is the mind of faith. âOne in mindâ means being âone in faithââone in our commitment to this Buddhism and its practice. Thatâs the real meaning of âmany in body, one in mind.â When young people have a strong mind of faith, a strong commitment to Buddhism, they will never be defeated.â

âMany in body, one in mindâ is not something as superficial as just getting along well together. The âmindâ in question is the mind or spirit to believe wholeheartedly in the Gohonzon, to never stray from the example of Nichiren Daishoninâs life, and to forge ahead tirelessly with our fellow practitioners to the very end. This unwavering faith is the âmindâ of âmany in body, one in mind.â Because we share the same commitment in faith and the same objective of kosen-rufu, we are comrades in faith and united in the spirit of âmany in body, one in mind.â

If that oneness of mind is easily shaken or undermined whenever something happens, then it didnât really exist in the first place; you were never truly âone in mindâ with other members. And that leads to defeat in life.

I hope you will take deeply to heart these words of Mr. Toda: âWhen young people have a strong mind of faith, a strong commitment to Buddhism, they will never be defeated.â
