Chapter 1.1 - Leading the Happiest of Lives
================================================

Part 1: Happiness; Chapter 1: What Is True Happiness?

"How do I live my life?" and "How can I live the very best life?" are fundamental questions that all humans must confront. While politics, economics, science, philosophy, and religion attempt to address how people should live, Buddhism uniquely provides a coherent answer grounded in the teachings of Shakyamuni Buddha, T'ien-t'ai, and Nichiren Daishonin.

A Thai proverb captures an important distinction: "False happiness makes people become haughty and arrogant. Real happiness makes people joyful and fills them with wisdom and compassion." True happiness is not merely wealth or material comfort, but what President Toda called "absolute happiness"—a state of life where one finds joy regardless of circumstances.

Nichiren Daishonin emphasized that "Both oneself and others together will take joy in their possession of wisdom and compassion." Through Buddhist practice, practitioners can transform life's inevitable sorrows, sufferings, and challenges into sources of strength and meaning.

Faith serves as the engine enabling perseverance through life's difficulties. When chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, practitioners develop the capacity to transform negative experiences into positive growth. The Daishonin teaches that "Myo means to revive, that is, to return to life," describing the Mystic Law's power to revitalize all aspects of existence.

Regarding karma, while past existences shape present circumstances, Nichiren Buddhism emphasizes the present and future. By embracing faith in the Mystic Law, individuals can transform negative karma and develop their lives boundlessly, revealing infinite possibilities within themselves.
