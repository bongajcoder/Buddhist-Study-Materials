Chapter 17: Making the Most of Each Day [17.7]

17.7 âOne Day of Life Is More Valuable Than All the Treasures of the Major World Systemâ

President Ikedaâs motto is living each day to the fullest. Each day of life is incredibly precious. Here, he calls on us to make each day shine with the immeasurable value of life.

Nichiren Daishonin writes: âOne day of life is more valuable than all the treasures of the major world systemâ (WND-1, 955).

He says a single day of life is more precious than even the vastest collection of jewels. Today is important. I have made it my practice to value each day and dedicate my life to serving our members. This is my credo.

The Daishonin further states: âYou have encountered the Lotus Sutra [Nam-myoho-renge-kyo]. If you live even one day longer, you can accumulate that much more benefit. How truly precious your life is!â (WND-1, 955).

Your lives are precious and endowed with a profound mission. Though you may appear the same as others striving in society, your days spent working for kosen-rufu as Soka Gakkai members are all incomparably noble and everlasting in terms of time based on the eternity of life.

I hope you will strive to live each day to the fullest so that you can say that today was enjoyable, victorious, fulfilling, and free of regrets.

From a speech at a nationwide menâs division leaders meeting, Tokyo, October 10, 1992.
