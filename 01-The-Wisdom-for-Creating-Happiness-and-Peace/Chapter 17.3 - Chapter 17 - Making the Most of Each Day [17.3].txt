Chapter 17: Making the Most of Each Day [17.3]

17.3 âNow Is the Last Moment of Oneâs Lifeâ

In âThe Heritage of the Ultimate Law of Life,â Nichiren Daishonin writes: âFor one who summons up oneâs faith and chants Nam-myoho-renge-kyo with the profound insight that now is the last moment of oneâs life, the sutra [Lotus Sutra] proclaims: âWhen the lives of these persons come to an end, they will be received into the hands of a thousand Buddhas, who will free them from all fear and keep them from falling into the evil paths of existenceâ [LSOC28, 363]â (WND-1, 216). Based on this passage, President Ikeda discusses the ultimate spirit of faith.

âWith the profound insight that now is the last moment of oneâs lifeâ (WND-1, 216) doesnât simply mean being ready or resolved. âWith profound insightâ means recognizing and fully comprehending that this is the real nature of life.

We all think that we have plenty of time left in our lives. But none of us knows when death may overtake us. We may die in the next instant. That is the true reality of life.

Even if we were to be guaranteed another 20, 30, or even 50 years of life, such time spans are, in the context of eternity, no more than fleeting moments. This is another sense of the insight that ânow is the last moment of oneâs lifeâ (WND-1, 216).

Any thoughtful person, having understood this, cannot help feeling the profound significance of being alive now and practicing Nichiren Buddhism. Such things as worldly power, fame, and riches are irrelevant. To accumulate good fortune that will not perish with death and for the sake of the eternal future, we cannot but focus on the true purpose of life while exerting ourselves wholeheartedly in our Buddhist practice.

This is the ultimate spirit of faith. Even so, as Buddhists and as members of human society, we are not meant to literally renounce or sacrifice everything of this world. Rather, when we exert ourselves earnestly in faith and practice with the great objective of kosen-rufu, everything in our lives is put to good use based on the Mystic Law. That is the essence of our commitment to live with the awareness that ânow is the last moment of oneâs life.â

When we live each moment of our life with this commitment, we âwill be received into the hands of a thousand Buddhas, who will free [us] from all fear and keep [us] from falling into the evil paths of existenceâ (LSOC28, 363). That means that we attain a state of complete security and never fall into the evil paths of existenceânamely, the worlds of hell, hungry spirits, animals, and

On a superficial level, the passage âWhen the lives of these persons come to an end, they will be received into the hands of a thousand Buddhasâ (LSOC28, 363) seems to suggest that this takes place at the moment of death, but on a more profound level, âcome to an endâ refers to each successive moment in life. In that sense, it is describing a state that we can actually attain while still alive.

The phrase ânow is the last moment of oneâs lifeâ urges us to put our entire being into the present moment. It means living each day wholeheartedly. It means to strive our hardest and give our all to achieve kosen-rufu and attain Buddhahood in this lifetime.

Even when it comes to sharing Buddhism with someone, if you allow the present opportunity to slip by, you never know if you will ever have another chance to talk to that person at length. Also, if you interact with people in earnest, based on the awareness that this is your only chance to help them transform their karma, you are already living with the spirit that ânow is the last moment of oneâs life.â

Whether you are chanting to the Gohonzon, engaged in Buddhist study, or writing words of encouragement to your friends and fellow membersâthe crucial thing is to devote yourself to that activity fully and wholly each moment.

Upon reflection, life is nothing more than the accumulation of each present moment. If you are unable to make today fulfilling, you wonât reap any positive results tomorrow. You can make the grandest long-term plans, but if you canât treasure each moment, those plans will just end as empty pipe dreams. Past causes and future results are all encapsulated in the true aspect of all phenomena

in the present moment, and a transformation in that single moment of life can both extinguish karmic impediments from the distant past and ensure good fortune that will continue into the eternal future.

This important passage from the Daishoninâs writings teaches the principle for changing our karma, the key to which lies in establishing solid faith based on the insight that ânow is the last moment of oneâs life.â

The worlds of hell, hungry spirits, animals,

are known together as the four evil paths. Considered the lowest four of the Ten Worlds, they are called evil because they are characterized by suffering.

True aspect of all phenomena: The ultimate truth or reality that permeates all phenomena and is in no way separate from them. Through the explanation of the ten factors, the âExpedient Meansâ (2nd) chapter of the Lotus Sutra teaches that all people are inherently endowed with the potential to become Buddhas, and clarifies the truth that they can tap and manifest this potential.
